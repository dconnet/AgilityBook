Building on Ubuntu Linux:
[note: C++ files now mostly compile. But linking fails for all executables.
Probably something in the make env.]

Needs boost:
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev

0. (cd into directory where you want to clone)
1. git clone https://github.com/dconnet/AgilityBook.git
2. cd AgilityBook
3. autoconf
4. mkdir bld
5. cd bld
6. ../configure
At this point the Makefile have been generated in all src subdirs and any changes to any of the Makefile.in files or the configure.in file will cause Makefiles to be be automatically regenerated.

So to build the application and related libs:
1. cd bld
2. make

Depending on where libraries and include files are installed you may need to add include file directories to the invocation of ../configure
For example on my Mac boost was installed in /opt/local/include/boost so I invoked configure as ../configure CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include

1. install wxgtk (out-of-date - on Ubuntu 18.04, this is wx3.0)
  Version 2.8.9 or later wxWidget package is required
  http://wiki.wxpython.org/InstallingOnUbuntuOrDebian
  sudo apt-get install wx2.8-i18n libwxgtk2.8-dev


2. make sure /usr/bin is on your path and wx-config can be found

Compiling Resources Manually
- This will go in the makefiles
1. in the root of the build directory:
cd ../src/Win/res && python ./compile.py ../../../build/src/Win arb
2. cd ../../../build/src/Win
3. sudo cp -pR lang/en/*mo /usr/share/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/
4. sudo cp -pR lang/fr/*mo /usr/share/locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES/
