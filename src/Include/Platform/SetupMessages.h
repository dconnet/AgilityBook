 * @brief Pragma messages to output
 * @author David Connet
 *
 * Include this in a compiled cpp. We could use stdafx.cpp, but that isn't
 * included in the Mac makefiles. So put it in the "main" file in each project.
 * Note: This is not in the main Setup*.h includes since the Mac-makefiles
 * do not use precompiled headers. Putting it there causes the pragma message
 * to output on every file - yuck!
 *
 * Must be included after stdafx.h (or SetupARBPre.h).
