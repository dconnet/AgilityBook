/**
 * @file
 * @brief EXE/DLL version number
 * @author David Connet
 *
 * @note To use this in VERSIONINFO, the VERSIONINFO resource must be moved
 * into the .rc2 file (non-editable resources). In addition, the vcproj files
 * need to have "../../Include" set on the project resource section (that path
 * is relative to the vcproj file). DO NOT include this file in the main .rc
 * as an include in the TEXTINCLUDE2 section. Otherwise you will have a
 * problem opening the resources in the resource editor as that needs a path
 * relative to the .rc file. (Ok, you could do this if you _also_ add
 * "../Include" to the vcproj resource path, but that just seems weird).
 * Since this file is only used in the rc2 file, just include it there.
 * This keeps all editors/compilers happy.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: When updating the version, also update ../../configure.in
 * (The actual version number is auto-updated, but the copyright is not)
 *
