<h1>Configuration Dialogs</h1>
<p>The <a href="DlgConfig.html">Configuration</a> is probably the most 
complicated area in the program. Most people will never find the need to change 
anything here, with the exception of <a href="DlgOtherPoints.html">Other Points</a>.</p>
<p>The Configuration is what drives the entire program. It defines how each 
venue works. This allows new venues to be added to the program without the need 
for a new release. You can either create a new venue yourself, or you can import 
one someone else has created.</p>
