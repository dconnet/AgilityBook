<h1>Assign Columns Dialog</h1>
<p>The Assign Columns dialog is used in several locations.
It is used when configuring the columns in each of the main views.
It is also used when importing and exporting data.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgAssignColumns.gif"></p>
<p>The items listed in the <b>Run Type</b> list will be different depending
on where this dialog is started from.
When started from a main view that has a splitter,
the view that currently has focus will determine the items visible.
When importing and exporting data (displayed image above) it is very
important to make sure that you configure each of the items in the Run
Type list.</p>
<p>The fields listed on the left are all the fields that it is possible to
configure.
The fields listed on the right are the fields that are currently in use.
These can be ordered by using the <b>Move Up</b> and <b>Move Down</b>
buttons.
Use the <b>Add</b> and <b>Remove</b> buttons to move the fields back
and forth.
The <b>Reset</b> button can be used to change all values to their
original values.
In addition, when importing and exporting data, there is a special field,
<b>&lt;Blank Column&gt;</b>, that can be used to skip fields that are
in the imported data,
or to create blank columns when exporting.</p>
