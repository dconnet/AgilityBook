<h1>Calendar Plugins Dialog</h1>
<p>The Calendar Plugins dialog allows you to read calendar entries from
different locations on the Internet.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgCalendarPlugins.gif"></p>
<p>When this dialog starts, it searches for any plugin DLLs in the executable's
directory and configuration file.
These are displayed with a check mark.
This mark indicates to the <b>Read Entries</b> button which items will have
their calendar data loaded.
Depending on the web site, this action may take several minutes.</p>
<p>Once the calendar entries are pulled over, the entries are displayed under
their plugin.
Checking the calendar entries you want to import will allow the
<b>Add Entries</b> button to add and/or update existing entries.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a plugin will become disabled.
This is normally because the web site where we read the data from has changed
format.
Until a new release of the plugin is made available,
or the web site format changes back, there is nothing that can be done.
However, if the plugin became disabled because the web site was temporarily
down, it can be re-enabled with the <b>Enable</b> button.</p>
<p>Some plugins have additional data that can be configured for the initial
query (the <b>Read Entries</b> button).
This data can limit the locations and venues that are returned.
Click the <b>Details...</b> button to display the following dialog:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgCalendarPluginsQueryDetail.gif"></p>
<p>In addition, plugins that are contained within the configuration (as
opposed to a DLL like the USDAA item above) can be created and modified here.
Selecting <b>New</b> will create a new plugin in this file's configuration.
Selecting <b>Edit</b> will allow modification of an existing plugin.
(Note, DLLs have no configuration that can be altered, nor can they be
deleted here.) Upon creating a new plugin, the following dialog is displayed:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgCalendarPluginsEdit.gif"></p>
<p>The <b>Search URL</b> is the URL that the program will use to read data
from the web. There are two &quot;magic&quot; strings: <b>!L!</b> and
<b>!V!</b>. If present, these will be replaced with the user-selected locations
and venues (these codes are configured below). Multiple items will be separated by a '+' character.</p>
<p>The <b>Codes...</b> button will allow you to configure Locations and Venues
that can be queried directly. If the web site does not support limiting a
search, there is no need to configure any codes.</p>
