<h1>Import Export Wizard</h1>
<p>The Import Export Wizard allows you to add data in and copy it out for use in 
other programs. For instance, the data analysis aspects of Agility Record Book 
are rather limited. This is by-design. There are many other programs in 
existence that can analyze data far better than I can. So this provides the 
facility to get the data out of this program in a form the other program can 
use.</p>
<p>The Wizard starts by <a href="DlgWizardStart.html">determining what you want 
to do</a>. Based on the selections you make in this dialog, the action is either 
completed, or you are taken to the <a href="DlgWizardImport.html">import</a> or
<a href="DlgWizardExport.html">export</a> portion of the wizard.</p>
