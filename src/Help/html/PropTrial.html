<h1>Trial Properties</h1>
<p>The Trial Properties dialog is displayed when you create a new trial or edit 
an existing one. A trial can be created in two ways: by creating the trial directly, or by 
creating it from a calendar entry.</p>
<h2><a name="Directly">Creating a trial directly</a></h2>
<p>A trial can be created directly when the Runs tab is activated. If you have 
multiple dogs, it will be created in the dog that is currently selected.</p>
<h2><a name="Calendar">Creating a trial from a calendar entry</a></h2>
<p>A trial can be created from a calendar entry by selecting the &quot;<a href="MenuCalendar.html">Create 
Trial Entry</a>&quot; context menu item or the &quot;<a href="PropCal.html">Create Trial</a>&quot; 
button. If you have multiple dogs, a <a href="DlgDogPicker.html">selection 
dialog</a> will be presented after you enter all the details of the trial, allowing you to select which dogs you want to 
create this trial for.</p>

<p>The Location field contains a list of locations from all the trials you have 
created and all of the calendar entries. You may also type anything you want in 
this field. When the value in this field is changed, the top edit control
on the right side will be updated with any previously saved
<a href="DlgJudgeInfo.html">Location Information</a>.</p>
<p>The Verified checkbox is for your information - it is used to note that the 
results in the trial have been verified. For instance, AKC posts all trial 
results online at <a href="http://www.akc.org/dic/events/search/">
http://www.akc.org/dic/events/search/</a>.</p>
<p>The Notes field is for any information you wish to comment on. When creating 
a trial directly from a calendar entry, this field will initially contain the 
notes from the calendar entry.</p>
<p>The <a name="Club">Club</a> list generally only contains a single club. However, when a trial is 
co-sanctioned, this field contains a list of all the co-sanctioning clubs. The 
order the clubs are listed in is extremely important - actually, the first club 
listed is the critical information. The club that is listed first is the venue 
that will be used for establishing the rules for this trial. For instance, if 
you have a NADAC/ASCA trial and the ASCA club is listed first, it will not be 
possible to create a Touch-N-Go run. When a club is selected, the lower edit
control on the right side will be updated with any previously saved
<a href="DlgJudgeInfo.html">Club Information</a>.</p>
</p>
<p>The New/Edit buttons bring up the following dialog.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgClub.gif"></p>
<p>The Name field will contain a list of all clubs that have been listed so far. 
You may type anything you want here.</p>
<p>The Venue field will contain a list of all currently configured venues. This 
list cannot be changed here. (If the configuration is changed, those changes 
will be reflected here.)</p>
