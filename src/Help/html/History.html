<h1>History of releases</h1>
	<ul>
		<li><b>7/3/2004: v1.2.0.8</b><ul>
		<li>Bumped file version to 9.0, Configuration v4<ul>
		<li>Added 'SubName' to 'Training'.</li>
		<li>Moved 'RegNum' data to 'Number', data is now 'Note'</li>
		<li>CPE 'CADE' changed to 'C-ATE'.</li>
		<li>Updated NADAC Gambler configuration to handle new Gambler class.</li>
	</ul>
		</li>
		<li>New features / Enhancements<ul>
		<li>Integrated help system.</li>
		<li>In the Points view, do not filter individual runs based on Qs 
		(use all other filter criteria). This allows us to show a qualifying 
		percentage.</li>
		<li>Added the Dogs call name, registered name and current date to 
		the top of the Points view (good when printing!).</li>
		<li>Allow users to specify their own splash screen. Only .bmp files 
		are supported (limited to Window's LoadImage API). Set in the 
		Options dialog.</li>
		<li>After adding a title, display the dog properties on title page. 
		Change the behavior in the Options dialog to restore previous 
		program behavior. (Too many people were having problems finding the 
		title later.)</li>
		<li>Added 'Sub-name' to the Training Log.</li>
		<li>Added an 'Open' button to the 'Find Links' dialog.</li>
		<li>Added status icons on the run dialog links page.</li>
		<li>Added full support for cut/copy/paste of dog/run/calendar/log 
		entries. Note, cut/copy is supported in the Run view, but paste is 
		not. You can copy an entry there and then paste it in the proper 
		place in the tree.</li>
		<li>When you open a file that has no dogs, you will be prompted to 
		create one.</li>
		<li>When creating a trial from a calendar entry, copy the notes too.</li>
		<li>Added the current dogs name to the status bar.</li>
		<li>Added indicators for how the lists are sorted.</li>
		<li>Added a note to a registration number.</li>
	</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Bug fixes<ul>
		<li>Lifetime point accumulation did not display the points for 
		existing runs.</li>
		<li>Quote exported data so non-tab delimiters work properly if the 
		delimiter character is actually part of the output data. Quotes are 
		added if needed. Also, on import, handle quotes properly. Quoting is 
		done like Excel.</li>
		<li>Fixed \r\n line ends in OtherPoints configuration dialog.</li>
		<li>When setting filter options on runs, it is possible that some 
		runs may be visible when they shouldn't.</li>
		<li>When filtering a dual-sanctioned trial, and the filtering 
		options were different, a run would end up visible in the points 
		view when it shouldn't. For instance, in an ASCA/NADAC trial, if you 
		set filtering to hide Novice runs in NADAC and not ASCA, the novice 
		runs were still visible under NADAC.</li>
		<li>Fixed a problem in the Points View with accumulating 
		non-qualifying runs when the filter was set to view only qualifying 
		or only non-qualifying.</li>

		<li>
			<b>4/30/2004: v1.1.0.8</b>
			<UL>
				<LI>
					Bumped file version to 8.6, configuration to version 3.
					<UL>
						<LI>
						Changed 'TableInYPS' to 'hasTable', added 'hasTable' to 'Scoring'
						<LI>
						Added 'Link' to 'Runs'
						<LI>
						Added 'LifeTime' to 'TitlePoints'
						<LI>
							Updated configuration with lifetime point information.</LI></UL>
				<LI>
					New features / Enhancements
					<UL>
						<LI>
							Instead of recording whether YPS should be adjusted for each run, just record 
							if that run has a table. A new option (under 'View') then determines how to 
							compute it. Old files will be auto-updated when the new configuration is 
							merged, <EM>as long as it happens during startup</EM>.
						<LI>
						Added Lifetime point accumulation information to USDAA and NADAC. Removed USDAA 
						LAA from OtherPoints. Also, updated DAM and Steeplechase to accumulate LAA 
						points from 1999 on.
						<LI>
						Changed 'Insert Course' to 'Paste Course' in run dialog. (For clarity)
						<LI>
						Added 'Links' in the run dialog and a corresponding 'Find Links' in the File 
						menu.
						<LI>
						Added simple sorting to the 3 main list views: Runs, CalendarList, Training
						<LI>
						Create a backup file before saving. This will be named "&lt;Name of existing 
						file&gt;.bck#" where # is a number from 1 to n (as defined below).
						<LI>
						Added a new page in the Options dialog for program options: number of backup 
						files and auto-update-check.
						<LI>
						Added 'Duplicate' menu item for trials/runs/calendar/training entries.
						<LI>
						Added a splash screen at start and as a menu option. (This is a picture of 
						Megan and me at the 2003 USDAA Nationals.)
						<LI>
							In multi-dog files, remember the last dog viewed when opening the file.</LI>
						<LI>
							When the program prompts to update the 
							configuration when a file opens, just merge the 
							default config instead of prompting.</LI></UL>
				<LI>
					Bug fixes
					<UL>
						<LI>
						When merging configuration information via the update feature, if only the 
						description was changed in either a venue or an event, that information did not 
						get properly merged.
						<LI>
						The 'View-&gt;Show Hidden Titles' menu item was never enabled.
						<LI>
						Fixed an inconsistency in pasting text from the clipboard. Sometimes the text 
						was garbled when pasting into the CRCD text box.
						<LI>
						The edit/delete buttons did not get enabled/disabled properly in the Reference 
						Runs in the Runs dialog.
						<LI>
						If opening a file for writing fails, the error message was wrong. (It reported 
						on the minimum required resolution.)
						<LI>
						If you imported a calendar listing that had a heading, but tried to parse the 
						heading as an entry, the program faulted.
						<LI>
						Fixed a problem encoding/decoding binary data. This affected pasting/viewing 
						the CRCD image.
						<LI>
							Some of the lists with sortable columns didn't properly remember their 
							settings.</LI>
						<LI>
							Changed how events are handled in the 
							configuration dialog to prevent that weird 
							memory access from happening.</LI></UL>
				</LI>
			</UL>
		<LI>
			<B>3/21/2004: v1.0.4.8</B><ul>
				<li>
					Bumped file version to 8.5<ul>
						<li>
						Added 'isHidden' to 'Title'.
						<li>
							Made 'Date' optional in 'Title'.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>
					New features / Enhancements<ul>
						<li>
						Changed Venue configuration slightly so it looks better (Divisions and Titles 
						headers)
						<li>
							Added the ability to hide a title. This allows you to hide an old title or a 
							title that you will never earn (for instance USDAA SSA, if you are in Masters 
							already)</li>
					</ul>
				<li>
					Bug fixes<ul>
						<li>
						When creating a new run in a new trial, the date did not get saved if we didn't 
						change it. This would only occur on the first run created and only if we didn't 
						change the date (in other words, we entered the run on the day we ran it)
						<li>
							In the run dialog, the text on the table-in-yps was inverted. Instead of asking 
							if you wanted to subtract for the table, it should have been asking it you 
							wanted to include (pretty obvious when you watched the yps change after 
							clicking the checkbox). In addition, it did not properly initialize when the 
							event type was changed.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>
			<b>3/8/2004: v1.0.3.8</b><ul>
				<li>
					Bumped file version to 8.4<ul>
						<li>
						Added table-in-yps flag (default is true for backwards compatibility)
						<li>
						Added new 'Configuration/Action' verb: DeleteTitle
						<li>
						Added 'version' to Configuration.
						<li>
							Added 'CRCDMeta' to Notes.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>
					New features / Enhancements<ul>
						<li>
						Added 'Check for Updates' on Help menu and About box.
						<li>
						Added auto-check - checks for updates every 30 days (enabled/disabled under 
						Help menu)
						<li>
						Add a 5-sec table YPS computation checkbox in the runs.
						<li>
						Added the ability to tell if the program contains an updated config. When you 
						open an old file, it will prompt to merge. Once you have updated, you will not 
						be prompted again, even if you modify your config.
						<li>
						Added additional text to email message generated from hotlink in About box.
						<li>
							Added MetaFile support into CRCD dialog. (When you paste a course from CleanRun 
							Course Designer, the image will also appear now)</li>
					</ul>
				<li>
					Bug fixes<ul>
						<li>
						Creating a new document didn't clear the judge info from the previous doc.
						<li>
						The OtherPoints button in the runs dialog was improperly disabled at times.
						<li>
						Removed 'V-ATCH',etc from ASCA configuration. (There is no veterans ATCH - an 
						ATCH is an ATCH is an ATCH...)
						<li>
							Removed AMBOR Triple title abbreviations - titles are full text.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>
			<b>2/9/2004: v1.0.2.8</b><ul>
				<li>
					Bumped file version to 8.3<ul>
						<li>
							Added Existing Points to dog properties.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>
					New features / Enhancements<ul>
						<li>
						Changed the Dog Property dialog to multiple tabs.
						<li>
						Added nice title names into the dog's property title page.
						<li>
							Updated dialog accelerators.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>
					Bug fixes<ul>
						<li>
						Updated NADAC Configuration with Novice/Open/Elite Triple Superior (mapped old 
						'Triple Superior' to 'Novice Triple...')
						<li>
						Updated ASCA Configuration with ATCHs.
						<li>
						Updated 2 CPE titles with long names.
						<li>
						Fixed a number of dialogs where data could be corrupted. (Note: In dialogs when 
						using a DDX variable after the dialog returns, be careful about modifying it - 
						CDialog::OnOK will force the UI data back into the variable)
						<li>
						When updating the configuration, you could get some false-positive messages 
						that things had changed. This was due to the order of items being different 
						(which we don't care about).
						<li>
							In the Run dialog<ul>
								<li>
								update the YPS when the time is changed.
								<li>
									update controls when date changes (in case different rules are in effect)</li>
							</ul>
						<li>
							Fixed some crasher bugs in the configuration dialog when creating/modifying a 
							venue.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>
			<b>1/26/2004: v1.0.1.8</b><ul>
				<li>
					New features / Enhancements<ul>
						<li>
						When starting the program, holding the SHIFT key down will prevent the last 
						file from being automatically opened.
						<li>
							Redesigned Configuration dialog for ease-of-use.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>
					Bug fixes<ul>
						<li>
							Titles that were edited/created were saved with the wrong name. This caused the 
							title to vanish after saving the file and re-opening it. [The fix will 
							auto-correct the problem titles, if they are still in the file] (bug was 
							introduced in 1.0.0.8.)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>
			<b>1/21/2004: v1.0.0.8</b><ul>
				<li>
					Bumped file version to 8.2<ul>
						<li>
						Added a new "Long Name" to the titles configuration.
						<li>
						Added 'Action' items to Configuration.
						<li>
							Height is no longer a required field in a run.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>
					New features / Enhancements<ul>
						<li>
						Began distributing an MSVC7 msi installation.
						<li>
						Added AAC and AMBOR configurations.
						<li>
						Updated USDAA configuration.
						<li>
						GetAllClubs/Locations now includes calendar entries.
						<li>
						Implemented column customizing in Tree, Runs, Calendar and TrainingLog.
						<li>
						Implemented importing from a spreadsheet.
						<li>
						The configuration and new title dialogs use the new long name (if available)
						<li>
						When renaming a title in the configuration and the new name already exists, ask 
						the user if they actually want to merge the existing titles into that name. 
						This allows us to change the name of a title non-destructively (though it 
						requires some work on the users part to rename)
						<li>
							As an addition to this, added the ability to merge items when doing a 
							configuration update.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>
					Bug fixes<ul>
						<li>
						Exporting the training log for import into a spreadsheet was wrong.
						<li>
						The points view didn't generate a venue header consistently if a venue had no 
						titles.
						<li>
						When entering a run, too much validation was being done at the wrong time. 
						(This could cause a 'Please enter an event' message when changing the date)
						<li>
							Total faults weren't updated when course faults changed.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>
			<b>12/28/2003: v0.9.5.8</b><ul>
				<li>
					Bumped file version to 8.1<ul>
						<li>
							Added 'ValidFrom' and 'ValidTo' dates to an events scoring method. This allows 
							an evolution of rules while preserving point accumulation.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>
					New features / Enhancements<ul>
						<li>
						Updated the initial support for the new USDAA titling (using ValidFrom/To) in 
						the default configuration.
						<li>
						Added support for evolving rules in the configuration dialog. An event scoring 
						method can be defined as being valid for a specific date range.
						<li>
						Changed how items are shown for export in the first wizard page (separated 
						spreadsheet/ARB items).
						<li>
						Added more items to import/export.
						<li>
						SpreadSheet Export: Can now export Calendar/TrainingLog
						<li>
						ARB Import: Can now import TrainingLog
						<li>
						ARB Export: Can now export TrainingLog
						<li>
							Added some new accelerators<ul>
								<li>
								Ctrl+E: Import/Export Wizard
								<li>
								Ctrl+F: Find (Find does not work in the points or calendar view)
								<li>
								F3: Find Next
								<li>
								Shift+F3: Find Previous
								<li>
								Ctrl+J: Judge's comments dialog\
								<li>
								Ctrl+R: Create a new run
								<li>
								F7: Viewing options dialog
								<li>
									F12: Save As</li>
							</ul>
						<li>
							Added a basic Find function. It is context sensitive to the active view.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>
					Bug fixes<ul>
						<li>
						Training log didn't re-sort if you edited an item.
						<li>
							Adding a calendar entry from the List dialog didn't set the icon properly.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>
			<b>12/13/2003: v0.9.4.8</b><ul>
				<li>
					Bumped file version to 8.0<ul>
						<li>
						Modified version number for better backwards compatibility.

					</ul>
				<li>
					New features / Enhancements<ul>
						<li>
						Expanded import/export

						<li>
						Enhanced copy support (ctrl+c)
						<li>
						Only copy selected items in lists.
						<li>
						Moved the copy that was in the calendar list to the calendar view. The calendar 
						view now generates a list similar to Karey's. The calendar list now copies like 
						the other lists do (whatever is visible in the list).
						<li>
						Added the ability to add comments to a judge (menu item "Edit-&gt;Judges")
						<li>
							Added a 'Valid From' date to an scoring configuration for an event. This is 
							currently saved, but not used. It will be used in the future to support changes 
							in venues (for instance, say the number of faults allowed for a given event 
							changes from 10 to 5)</li>
					</ul>
				<li>
					Bug fixes<ul>
						<li>
						Changed copyright notices from "(c)" to "©" (internal code, not visible)
						<li>
						Right-clicking on a Calendar entry sets that as the current date before popping 
						up the context menu.
						<li>
						Cleaned up page scrolling in calendar view.
						<li>
						When creating a calendar entry, the other view didn't update properly. Also, 
						when editing an entry in the list, the calendar view didn't update.
						<li>
						Fixed a crash when you tried to open a version of an ARB file that was saved 
						with a newer version of the program. This only happened when the program 
						auto-opened the last open file at startup.
						<li>
						Tallying QQs when a 3rd run is present was wrong in the Points view.
						<li>
							The QQ checkbox in the run dialog wasn't updating properly.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>
			<b>10/15/2003: v0.9.3.7</b><ul>
				<li>
					Bumped file version to 7<ul>

						<li>
							Added LAA Points to Other Points. Makes tracking easier.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>

						<li>
							Added option to not filter runs by selected trial.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>
					Bug fixes<ul>
						<li>
						In Reference Runs, default the score to a perfect score based on venue.
						<li>
						If a run does not have titling points, don't show it in the point summary.
						<li>
							Fixed a problem displaying Other Points, things could get mixed up.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>
			<b>9/29/2003: v0.9.2.6</b><ul>

					</ul>
				<li>
					New features / Enhancements<ul>
						<li>
						Training Log and filtering options for it.
						<li>
							Enhanced the 'Filtered' message to be sensitive to the current view.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>
					Bug fixes<ul>
						<li>
						When creating a trial entry from the calendar, if you selected more than one 
						dog at a time when creating the trial, that new trial was actually linked 
						together for both dogs. Changes in one were reflected in the other. The "link" 
						was fixed when the file was reloaded.
						<li>
						In the pairs partners dialog, the dog's number wasn't being saved.
						<li>
						Pasting a trial/run didn't mark the document as needing saving.
						<li>
						When adding/pasting a trial/run and the filtering options filtered that new 
						item out, a message appeared saying the run wasn't added. Actually it was, it 
						just wasn't visible. In addition, the (now) not visible run was not sorted 
						properly when the filtered was removed.
						<li>
						When updating a configuration, the scoring methods could get messed up.
						<li>
							CRCD data could be lost if a run contained no comments or faults.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>
			<b>9/3/2003: v0.9.0.5</b><ul>
				<li>
					- New features / Enhancements<ul>
						<li>
						Added a 'deceased' date to the dogs info. (This is a file version change but it 
						is backwards compatible, so theres no need to increment the file version)
						<li>
						Finished implementing OtherPoints point tallying.
						<li>
						Optimized filtering, much faster now.
						<li>
						Added filtering by qualifying/non-qualifying runs.
						<li>
						Added a 'Filtered' item to the status bar.
						<li>
						Added 'New dog/title/trial' items in the r-click menu of the Runs view.
						<li>

						<li>
						When copying an item in the tree, also copy some text to the clipboard.
						<li>
						Copy the runs in the view to the clipboard in tab-separated form (ctrl+c). It 
						is copied in the same format that it is printed in.
						<li>
						Added copy/paste menu items to the Tree's context menu.
						<li>
							When pasting a new trial or run, select the new item.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>
					Bug fixes<ul>
						<li>
						A change in 0.4.1.5 to compute the score on NQs was wrong - it computed the 
						score on all runs and title points on NQ+Qs. It should only compute score on 
						NQ+Q and title points on Qs. This only affected the run entry dialog and not 
						the point accumulation view.
						<li>
						Cleaned up selection synchronization in the runs and calendar views. The trial 
						run list selection now mirrors the tree selection.
						<li>
						Fixed bug where "ctrl+tab" didn't change tabs. "Shift+tab" was working.
						<li>
						In the calendar/faults/otherpts/partners dialog, set the selection when 
						adding/deleting items.
						<li>
							Fixed bug (crashes program) when copying the calendar list to the clipboard.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>
			<b>8/16/2003: v0.4.2.5</b><ul>
				<li>
					New features / Enhancements<ul>
						<li>

						<li>
						Removed automatic sorting of dogs - allow the user to set the ordering.
						<li>
						Added actual height and card received info to dog registration information.
						<li>
						When trying to cancel from the Run entry dialog, data verification prevented 
						the cancel from occurring.
						<li>
						Added toolbar items for new dog/title/trial/run/calendar and print preview.
						<li>
						Added new options page for fonts, added font for printing, moved calendar fonts 
						from calendar options page to this one.
						<li>
							In calendar view dialog (dbl-click, etc), show all entries for a date, even if 
							the 'hide on entered' option is on.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>
					Bug fixes<ul>
						<li>
							Allow screen font selection for calendar printer items. Also the wrong font was 
							displayed for the date on the printer.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>
			<b>7/23/2003</b><ul>
				<li>
					Source released on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/agilitybook">SourceForge.net</a>. 
					Releases are now done on both Yahoo and SourceForge.</li>
			</ul>

						<li>
						Have the calendar start with the current day as the current selection.
						<li>
						Changed the way titling points are configured.
						<li>
						Changed calendar current day highlighting so you can tell when the view is 
						active. Highlighting is based on system colors.
						<li>
						Automatically compute the score in the dog event dialog on both Q and NQ runs. 
						Previously, it only computed on Qs.
						<li>
						When entering trial data, "remember" certain fields to make data entry easier. 
						[Division, Level, Height, Handler, Judge]
						<li>
						Add opening points for gamblers/etc into configuration.
						<li>
						When errors are found when loading the data, the program attempts to keep 
						going. It used to just quit and you would have no data.
						<li>
						Complete an "Update rules" mechanism to allow importing updated rules. This 
						will merge changes. It will not delete entries in your configuration that are 
						not in the new one, with one exception: Event scoring methods
						<li>
						Added performance pairs in USDAA (non-titling)
						<li>
							Added UKC.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>
					Bug fixes<ul>
						<li>
						Fixed date overlap test. If 2 date ranges only partially overlapped, the test 
						was wrong. This resulted in calendar entries being visible when they shouldn't 
						have been.
						<li>
						Copying the calendar data to the clipboard didn't insert a newline after the 
						header.
						<li>
						If the viewing filter was enabled and you changed the venue of an existing

						suppressed it.
						<li>
						The program didn't always prompt to save on close when something changed.
						<li>
						When creating new faults, they didn't show up in the list until after the run 
						was saved.

							no warnings.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>
			<b>6/15/2003: v0.3.0.2</b><ul>
				<li>
					Bumped file version to 4<ul>
						<li>
						Added item to configuration scoring methods to drop fractional time faults.
						<li>
							Added a description to venues and events in the configuration.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>
					New features<ul>
						<li>
						Added CPE to default configuration.
						<li>
						Enable copy/paste of trials and runs.
						<li>
						Added filtering on multiple venues.
						<li>
						Tally points by level, not sublevel. Then things like NADAC Novice A/B add up 
						in one place.
						<li>
							Points View: Tally Clean/Unclean Qs</li>
					</ul>
				<li>
					Bug fixes<ul>
						<li>
						Wasn't remembering the selected view between program invokations.
						<li>
						NewLine wasn't handled properly in Event Configuration dialog notes.
						<li>
							Editing an existing configuration Title failed with the message that it already 
							exists. (divisions/levels/faults/otherpts too)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>
			<b>6/2/2003: v0.3.0.1</b><ul>
				<li>
					Bumped file version to 3<ul>
						<li>
						Add notes to configuration events specifically for USDAA DAM jumpers and 
						snooker - the fact the "Q" there applies towards master legs and DAM relay Q 
						implies the team qualified overall.
						<li>
						Moved Fault Types in configuration from Venue to global.
						<li>
						Moved Other Points in the same manner.
						<li>
							Added 'Received' field to Title.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>
					New features<ul>
						<li>
						Create a trial entry from a calendar entry.
						<li>
						Add a delay factor to auto-delete of old calendar entries. (default: 5 days)
						<li>
						Allow runs (in tree) and faults (in run) to be reordered. Note, sometimes it 
						will appear reordering fails. This will be due to sorting. For instance, runs 
						and calendar entries are sorted by date, then reordering.
						<li>
							Added initial configuration updating. It will add any new entries, but will not 
							yet update existing entries.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>
					Minor enhancements<ul>
						<li>
						Updated default USDAA config rules.
						<li>
						Tally the list of fault types like I do with judges. (You don't need to modify 
						the configuration to have a new fault type show up in the selection list)
						<li>
						In points view, show the number of partners for Qs, not just total number of 
						partners. When tallying the number of pairs partners, only 2-dog relays are 
						tallied. This prevents some odd things when counting USDAA DAM tournament 
						relays.
						<li>
						After creating a new dog/trial/run (via rclick menu), make that the selected 
						item. (The wrong item was selected if you rclicked on an entry other than the 
						current selection)
						<li>
						When entering a new run, the default date should be last date in the trial.
						<li>
						Modified calendar entry dialog to show trial opening/closing dates.
						<li>
						When an entry in the calendar list is selected, make calendar date in the right 
						window pane selected too.
						<li>
						Added an 'edit' button to edit an existing registration num
						<li>
						Added an 'edit' button to edit an existing club
						<li>
						After inserting a trial/run in the tree, it was not properly sorted.
						<li>
						Add column sorting to reference runs.
						<li>
							Add option to reverse-sort trials and runs (newest first). This will also 
							reverse the user re-ordering.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>
					Bug fixes<ul>
						<li>
						Changing the Selected dog didn't update the points view.
						<li>
						Points view: QQ tallied wrong (it was double counting)
						<li>
						When venues are not filtered, ASCA pts were incorrectly totaled.
						<li>
						When modifying a configuration event, when a new div/level pair was created, 
						the 'not defined' items weren't updated.
						<li>
							When an event is not qualifying (as defined in the configuration), the "q" list 
							was still available when entering a run - not really an issue since it didn't 
							get tallied.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>
			<b>4/3/2003: v0.2.0.3</b><ul>
				<li>

				<li>

				<li>
				Added initial points reporting.
				<li>
				Made 'Height' a required field during data entry to agree with the file format 
				(and prevent file corruption)
				<li>
				In run entry dialog, show total faults.
				<li>
				Add support for bold/italic options in fonts
				<li>
					Bug fixes<ul>
						<li>
						Initial dates could end up with really odd values
						<li>
						Comboboxes that allow data entry do not scroll.
						<li>
						Sort order of titles in Dog properties didn't remember multiple column sort 
						properly.
						<li>
						Calendar: Turning on the 'hide overlap' option didn't hide trials that 
						partially overlap
						<li>
							Display correct title pts in time+faults runs when there are faults.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>
			<b>2/23/2003: v0.2.0.2</b><ul>
				<li>
					Modified default rules to add USDAA's Tournament classes.<ul>
						<li>
							If you have an existing file, the only way to get the new default rules is to 
							hand edit. A future enhancement is to add an automated way of doing this. 
							Currently: Create a new empty file and save it. Copy everything between 
							"&lt;Configuration&gt;" and "&lt;/Configuration&gt;" are replace the lines in 
							your current file. Be careful!</li>
					</ul>
				<li>
					Bug fixes<ul>
						<li>

						<li>
						Made comboboxes for division and level wider in the RunEntry dialog.
						<li>
						Made the combobox for a new fault longer
						<li>
						Made '0' the default from score in the reference run dialog.
						<li>
						In the 'Other Points' dialog, made the description an edit field so it can 
						scroll.
						<li>
							When modifying the configuration, the scoring methods were not updated.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>
			<b>2/21/2003: v0.2.0.1</b><ul>
