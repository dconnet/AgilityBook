<h1>Configuration Dialog</h1>
<p>The main Configuration dialog presents four main areas to work with:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#Venues">Venues</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Faults">Faults</a></li>
  <li><a href="#OtherPoints">Other Points</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Updating">Updating</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The four buttons, <b>New</b>, <b>Edit</b>, <b>Delete</b> and <b>Copy</b>, are
enabled based on the item in the tree that currently has focus.</p>
<p>The important thing to understand about the configuration is that it is part
of your data file. If you have two different files (for instance, you have two
dogs and decided to keep their information in separate files), then the
configuration for each dog is in that particular file. This means if you have
updated one of the configurations, that update has no effect on the other. (This
is convenient since if you just wanted to tinker the creating/modifying a venue,
it would have no impact on your real data - assuming you work in a separate
file!)</p>

<h2>
<a name="Venues">Venues</a></h2>
<p align="left">
When you create a new venue or edit an existing one, the
<a href="DlgConfigVenue.html">Venue Configuration dialog</a> will appear. This
is an area that you will probably not need to modify unless you are creating a
new venue. (If you create a new venue, I would really appreciate it if you would
<a href="Contact.html">send me</a> a copy. I can then include it in the default
configuration of the program. You can do this by running the Import Export
Wizard and selecting the &quot;Agility Record Book&quot; format and then Export
Configuration. The resulting file is what I'm interested in.)</p>
<h2>
<a name="Faults">Faults</a></h2>
<p>
When you create a new fault or edit an exiting one, the <a href="DlgFault.html">
Fault dialog</a> will appear. There is usually no need to create any additional
fault types here. Any that you create in any runs will appear automatically in
future dialogs. (If you feel there are faults that should be included here,
please let <a href="Contact.html">me know</a>.)</p>
<h2>
<a name="OtherPoints">Other Points</a></h2>
<p>
The Other Point configuration is probably the area a user is most likely to use.
Other Points may include things like Breed Points. From discussions with people,
these are computed differently in almost every breed. So rather than try and
handle that, I left it to you!</p>
<p>
The trick is to first configure the way points are done here. You can then enter
any points you earn in each <a href="PropRun.html">run</a> using the &quot;Other
Points&quot; button.</p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="images/DlgConfigOtherPoints.gif"></p>
<p>
<b>Name</b> is what you would like to call this Other Points item.</p>
<p>
<b>Tally Points</b> lists several ways that these points will be accumulated on
the <a href="TabPoints.html">Points View</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>All Events</b> - This will accumulate all the Other Points found into a
  single entry. Older versions of the program used to do that to accumulate
  lifetime points.</li>
  <li><b>Tally by Event</b> - This accumulates all points earned in a specific
  event, regardless of division or level.</li>
  <li><b>Tally by Level</b> - This accumulates all points earned in a specific
  division and level, regardless of event.</li>
  <li><b>Tally by Level and Event</b> - This accumulates points based the the
  division and level, and event.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Description</b> is a good place to put an explanation of how the points are
computed. When you create a entry on a run, all you enter is the number of
points earned, so having the computation in front of you when you enter those
points is very handy.</p>
<h2><a name="Updating">Updating</a></h2>
<p>The <b>Update Configuration</b> button will bring up the following dialog:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgConfigUpdate.gif"></p>
<p>This dialog allows you to merge in the default configuration (the one
built into the program), or to select a specific file to merge. When a new
version of the program is released and the configuration has changed, the
program will prompt you at that point if you would like to update your
configuration. At that point, it has automatically selected the
<b>Use Default Configuration</b> option for you and by-passed the above
dialog. However, if you opted not to update at that point, you can do so
again at any time by using this dialog. (Updating the configuration is
also available in the Import Export Wizard.)</p>
<p>If you select the <b>Use Existing Configuration</b> option, you must
select the name of a file containing the information you wish to merge.
This may happen if the configuration requires updating, but the program
does not. It may also happen if a friend of yours creates a new venue
and gives you the file so you can also use that venue.</p>
<p>Once you press <b>OK</b>, the update will proceed and you will then be
presented with the results of that merge. Note, the merge process will
<i>not</i> remove any data. Updating is usually a non-destructive process.
(The only time it may be destructive is if a venue has changed significantly
and revoked an existing title. So far, this has never happened. Names have
changed, but that is different.) If you have removed venues from your
configuration, the update process will restore them if they exist in the
configuration being merged.</p>
<p><b>Important</b>: In verion 1.2.1.8, a bug was identified that could cause
a loss of data. In fixing the bug, it was determined that there are
situations during the update process that can cause a loss of data. This
is unavoidable. When the configuration for an event is modified (either
directly, or via the update process), that may cause a
<a href="images/DlgConfigEvent.gif">scoring method</a> to be modified or
even removed. When this occurs, it is necessary to update any existing
runs. If a scoring method has been removed, than any runs making use of
that method must also be removed. If it has been modified, then a run
may lose some data (for instance, if the scoring style changes from
<i>Time Plus Faults</i> to <i>Faults Then Time</i>). During the update
process, you will be warned that this may occur and what to do to avoid it.
