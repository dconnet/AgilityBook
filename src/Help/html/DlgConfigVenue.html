<h1>Venue Configuration Dialog</h1>
<p>The Venue Configuration dialog allows you to edit various aspects about a 
specific venue.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgConfigVenue.gif"></p>
<p>The venue <b>Name</b> must be unique.
There cannot be two venues with the same name.
The <b>URL</b> field is used to enter the venue's URL.
The <b>Description</b> field is for any comments you wish to make.</p>
<p><b>Lifetime Points Name</b> is used to change the name of Lifetime Points
in the Points view. Some venues have special names for this, such as UKC
which uses 'All Star'. If you set a value here, do not append 'Points' to
the name. The program will do that automatically.</p>
<p>The six buttons located in the center of the dialog are sensitive to which 
control last has focus. The text just below those buttons tell you what item 
they will act on.</p>
<p>When you first open this dialog for an existing venue, the <b>Titles</b> 
section will appear blank. This is because titles are assigned to a specific 
division. You must select a division before anything will appear. In the above 
dialog, the &quot;Standard&quot; division has been selected. All titles available in the 
Standard division are then visible in the Titles section. The <b>Levels</b> 
section is also sensitive to the selected division.</p>
<p>Only the <b>Levels</b> section can have sub-items. Sub-items are items that 
are located under another. For instance, &quot;Novice A&quot; is a sub-item of &quot;Novice&quot;.</p>
<p>When you create or edit the name of a division or level, a simple dialog 
asking for the name will open.</p>
<p>When you create or edit an event, the <a href="DlgConfigEvent.html">Event 
Configuration dialog</a> will open.</p>
<p>When you create or edit a Multiple Q, the following dialog will open:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgConfigMultiQ.gif">
<br/>This dialog allows you to associate several runs together for scoring
purposes. Currently, AKC uses this for their DoubleQ and UKC uses it for their
TripleQ. Clicking the <b>Add</b> or <b>Edit</b> button will bring up the
following dialog:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgEventSelection.gif"></p>
<p>When you create or edit a title, the following dialog will open:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgConfigTitle.gif"></p>
<p>The <b>Name</b> of the title is the abbreviation,
for instance &quot;NATCH&quot;.</p>
<p>The <b>Long Name</b> is a more descriptive name,
for instance &quot;NADAC Agility Trial Champion&quot;.</p>
<p>The <b> Description</b> section is for any notes you would like to make,
typically what it takes to earn this title.</p>
<p><b>Allow multiple</b> allows a title to be added more than once.
Typically, once you have earned a title, you cannot earn it again.
However, in some venues, the higher level titles can repeat. An example of
this is the MACH title in AKC.
The <b>Start at</b> field is used to specify where the repeating title will
start. Usually this is 2. In some cases, like NADAC, this will start higher
due to other existing titles.</p>
<p>The <b>Valid From</b> and <b>Valid To</b> fields allow for a new title to
be phased in, or an older title to be phased out. These only affect whether
the title will be shown to the user for selection. They allow for evolving
rule changes within a venue.</p>
