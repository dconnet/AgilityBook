<h1>Program Options</h1>
<p>The Program options allow you to configure a variety of general program
items.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgOptionsPgm.gif"></p>
<p>By default, the program checks to see if there is a new version once every 30
days. The check simply reads a file located at
<a target="new" href="http://www.agilityrecordbook.com/version.txt">
http://www.agilityrecordbook.com/version.txt</a>, This action is performed when
the program starts or the user specifically selects a
<a href="MenuMain.html#CheckforUpdates">menu item</a> or clicks the button in
the <a href="DlgAbout.html">About dialog</a>. If a newer version is
available, you are asked if you would like to download it. If you answer yes,
your web browser is started using the URL
&quot;<a target="new" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=86294">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=86294</a>&quot;.
This is just one location where the installation program is available. Once you
download the program, you must then install it. Agility Record Book does not
attempt to do any of this behind your back.</p>
<p>In addition, the program will check to see if a newer configuration is
available each time you open a document. This information is contained in the
file <b>version.txt</b> mentioned above. If a newer version is available, you
will be prompted to upgrade. Unlike the previous update, this one will actually
do the update. Note: this check will only occur if you have previously checked
for updates - it will <i>not</i> access the web itself. This is because
accessing a file on the web may take some time - delaying a file open to
do this is not acceptable, so when an update check is actually done, we
cache that information for future use.</p>
<p>The <b>Number of backup copies</b> option allows you to make a backup each time you
save the file. If your file name is &quot;Megan.arb&quot;, then the backup files are named
&quot;Megan.arb.bck<i>n</i>&quot; where <i>n</i> is a digit. The greater the digit, the
older the backup file. This is handy in case you save something you didn't want
to, or if for some reason saving the file caused the current copy to become
corrupted.</p>
<p>The <b>Show splash screen</b> option allows you to show (or hide) a splash screen
when the program starts.
If this name is blank or the image cannot be loaded, then the default
image is used.
(The default image is a picture of Megan and myself at the 2003
USDAA Nationals in Irving Texas.
Many thanks to Christine McHenry of Skipper Productions for permission to use
this image.)
The only caveat to this option is that you
must specify a Windows bitmap (.bmp) file.</p>
<p>The <b>Use HTML in Points View</b> option allows you to view the Points
View in Html.
If this option is disabled, you do not have a valid version of
Internet Explorer installed (IE 5.0 sp2 or higher).
If you turn this option off, the original Points View (a list) will be used.
One big advantage to using HTML is its superior printing ability.
Changing this option requires restarting the program.</p>
<p>All View Options are saved into the local Windows Registry.</p>
