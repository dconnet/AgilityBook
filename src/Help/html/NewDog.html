<h1>Create a dog</h1>
<p>When you open Agility Record Book for the first time, it may be a little 
unclear what you can do. When looking at the Runs tab, the first thing you must 
do is create a dog. Almost all actions that you do in the program are based on 
what is currently selected. So, we must create something!</p>
<p>The easiest way to create a dog is to use the toolbar button <img border="0" src="images/ToolbarNewDog.gif" width="18" height="17">. 
Simply click it with the mouse. Alternatively, you can use the &quot;New&quot; menu 
located under &quot;Agility&quot;.</p>

<p>Once a dog is created, you can right-click on an item in the tree and select 
the menu &quot;New-&gt;Dog&quot;.</p>
