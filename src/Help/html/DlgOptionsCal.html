<h1>Calendar Options</h1>
<p>The Calendar option page is used to set various Calendar options.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgOptionsCal.gif"</p>
<p>The <b>Calendar List</b> section allows you to modify how entries appear in
the list when they have an opening and/or closing date and you have marked that
you are going to enter them.</p>
<ul>
	<li>When &quot;Warn when the Opening date is near&quot; is enabled,
	entries that you are planning on entering will be displayed in the
	specified color when the current date is within the given range.</li>
	<li>When &quot;Warn when the Closing date is near&quot; is enabled,
	entries that you are planning on entering will be displayed in the
	specified color when the current date is within the given range.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <b>Calendar View</b> section allows you to modify how the calendar
looks.</p>
<p><b>First day of the week</b> allows you can change which day of the week
should appear at the start of each line.</p>
<p>Once a date has passed, the old entry can either
be hidden (<b>Hide past Entries</b>)
or deleted (<b>Automatically delete past entries</b>).
In either case, you can configure the program to define how much time
should pass before an entry is considered past. (If both options are set,
delete takes precedence.)
Setting this value too low can make it difficult if you wish to create a
trial directly from the calendar entry.
(Say you set the value to 1, then on the Wednesday after a weekend trial
you want to enter your runs into the program - the calendar entry will no
longer be available to create the trial entry from since it is now more than
one day after the end of the trial.)</p>
<p>The <b>Hide entries on dates where you've entered a trial</b> is convenient
for hiding trials that you will not be entering. It helps keep the calendar
from being too cluttered.</p>
<p><b>View Opening dates</b> will add the opening date onto the calendar for any
entries that have an opening date and are marked that you are planning on
entering them. Similarly, closing dates are added onto the calendar when <b>View
Closing dates</b> is set. If planned-on entries are filtered, opening and
closing dates will be filtered also.</p>
<p>The <b>Calendar Entries</b> combobox contains five entries: &quot;Not
Entered&quot;, &quot;Planning&quot;, &quot;&nbsp; Opening&quot;,
&quot;&nbsp; Closing&quot;, &quot;Entered&quot;. The <b>Set Color</b>
button that follows allows you to set the color for the currently selected item.
When you change the color of an item, the area below will be updated giving a
preview of what each entry will look like.</p>
<p>Finally, the <b>Set Font</b> button in this section will set the font used in
the Calendar View while viewing.
(When printing, the font specified in the Printing options will be used.)</p>
<p>All options are saved into the local Windows Registry.</p>
