<h1>Run Properties</h1>
<p>The Run Properties dialog allows you to enter all the information about a run
you have done. Each run belongs to the trial in which you created it, so the
Venue, Club and Location fields are only shown for convenience.</p>
<p>The following images show a variety of styles this dialog may take.
The fields that are visible depend on the type of run that is selected.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgRunsAKC.gif"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgRunsNADAC.gif"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgRunsGamblers.gif"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgRunsSnooker.gif"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgRunsPairs.gif"></p>
<p>When you create a new trial, the date will default to either the current date
(if there are no other runs in the trial), or the last day that has been entered
in the current trial. The <b>Division</b>, <b>Level</b> and <b>Event</b> fields
are dependent on each other. You will see no data in the lower ones until you
have selected a value in the upper ones. Only values that are valid (determined
by the <a href="DialogsConfig.html">configuration</a>) are shown.</p>
<p>Several fields will remember their values each time you create a run:
Division and Level (if the values are valid for the given venue), Height, Judge
and Handler.</p>
<p>The <b>Conditions</b> field is where you can enter the surface conditions,
weather, etc.</p>
<p>The <b>Number of Obstacles</b> field allows you to enter the number of
obstacles you attempted. This allows tracking the number of obstacles per
second which can greatly aid in planning gamble-style courses. The <b>Obstacles
per second</b> field is computed using the dog's time, unless this is a
run that has an opening and closing period. In that case, the lessor of the
opening time and dog's time will be used.</p>
<p>The <b>Place</b> field is where you can enter how you did. If you do not know
how you did (or a placement isn't valid due to elimination, etc) or you do not
know how many dogs competed, simply leave this value as 0. The program will know
not to use this data then.</p>
<p>The <b>Dogs Q'd</b> field is where you can record how many dogs qualified. If
you do not know this value, leave this as -1. Do not leave it as 0 (as with the
placement fields) as that would infer that no dogs qualified.</p>
<p>The <b>Q?</b> field is where you record the qualifying status. Available
values are: <b>NA</b> (Not applicable), <b>Q</b> (Qualified), <b>NQ</b> (Not
Qualified), <b>E</b> (Eliminated) or <b>SQ</b> (Super Qualifier, only shown in
applicable events).</p>
<p>The <b>Score</b> field will show the score for this run. The meaning of this
value is totally dependent on what the event is.</p>
<p>The <b>Title Points</b> will display how many points you have earned towards
a title.</p>
<p>The <b>Bonus Points</b> field will be visible if the configuration has
enabled that feature for this run. This allows you to enter <i>extra</i>
titling points that are not otherwise computed automatically. This applies
specifically to NADAC when a Bonus Box is present and successfully completed.
Please note, no verification is done on this field which allows you to enter
any value you want. Currently, the only values that should be entered are
<b>0</b> and <b>5</b>. And 5 should only be entered on a qualifying run with
no faults.
<p>The <b>Other Points</b> button allows you to configure points you may have
earned for this run that are not directly recognized by Agility Record Book. For
instance, breed points. This will bring up a dialog listing all the Other Points
you have entered. When you create a new entry or edit an existing one, you will
be taken to the <a href="DlgOtherPoints.html">Other Points dialog</a>.</p>
<p>Any fields not mentioned apply to a particular event. Relevant fields will
be visible, others will be hidden (as the images above show).
When you enter an event that is based on time-plus-faults,
time faults will not be computed.
If you enter 0 for a run that is faults-then-time,
time faults will also not be computed.
The YPS (yards per second) will be computed automatically when you enter
a course time and yardage.
If the yardage is not known or not applicable, leave this value as 0.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgRunsComments.gif"></p>
<p>The Comments/Faults page allows you to enter any comments you wish to make.
The <b>Faults</b> button will bring up a dialog listing all the faults (these
are also shown in the right side above). From that dialog, you can create a new
entry or edit an existing one in the <a href="DlgFault.html">Fault dialog</a>.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgRunsReference.gif"></p>
<p>The Reference Runs pane allows you to record information about other dogs who
did this event. This allows you to see how you are doing compared to others.
The <b>Add Me</b> button allows you to easily add your own information here
(assuming you have filled out the 'Score' tab already).</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgRunsCRCD.gif"></p>
<p>The CRCD (Clean Run Course Designer) page allows you to copy a course from
CRCD into Agility Record Book. When the <b>Insert Course</b> button is active,
it will copy any text that is in the clipboard into this window. It may not be a
valid CRCD image - Agility Record Book does not know that. It simply acts as a
storage area for text. If you copy the course while CRCD is running, CRCD will
also place an image on the clipboard. When you insert the course, Agility Record
Book will insert both the text and the image. If the image is available, you
will see it in the above window and the <b>Course Viewer</b> button will be
active. That button will bring up a <a href="DlgCRCDViewer.html">window</a> that
will allow you to resize the image.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgRunsLinks.gif"></p>
<p>The Links pane allows you to create links to external files. This can be
convenient if you have used a scanner to create an image of a course. If you
move (via the file system) any link or wish to copy this file to another
machine, use the <a href="DlgFindLinks.html">Find Links</a> dialog to find any
links that may need either fixing or copying. The <b>New</b> and <b>Edit</b>
buttons will take you to the <a href="DlgSelectUrl.html">Select URL dialog</a>.</p>
