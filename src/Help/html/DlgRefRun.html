<h1>Reference Run Dialog</h1>
<p>The Reference Run dialog allows you to create or edit a run of another
dog in this event.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgRefRun.gif"></p>
<p><b>Place</b> is for where this dog placed.</p>
<p><b>Q?</b> is the qualifying status.</p>
<p><b>Time</b> is the time of the run.</p>
<p><b>Score</b> is the score the dog earned. This will initially be set to the 
value of a clean run. This varies by venue.</p>
<p><b>Height</b> is the dog's height.
This is useful when comparing against dogs you normally compete against in
other venues. Or, in venues that have multiple levels run the same course
(like AKC Excellent A/B, CPE Levels 4,5,C). I will often record additional
level information like "L4-16" for another dog if I were in "L5".</p>
<p><b>Name</b>, <b>Breed</b> and <b>Notes</b> should be obvious...</p>
