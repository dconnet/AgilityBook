<h1>Dog Properties</h1>
<p>The Dog Property dialog allows you to record quite a bit of information about 
your dog.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#Properties">Properties</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Titles">Titles</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Registration">Registration Numbers</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Existing">Existing Points</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Properties">Properties</a></h2>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgNewDogProp.gif" width="551" height="387"></p>
<p>The only field that you absolutely must fill out is the <b>Call Name</b>. All other 
fields are optional. Though you probably will want to set the <b>Birthday</b> to 
the correct date!</p>
<p>If your dog has passed away, checking the <b>Deceased</b> button will enable 
a date you can enter. Once this is done, the age of the dog will no longer be 
based on the current date.</p>
<p>The <b>Notes</b> field is for any miscellaneous data you may want to record, for 
instance, an embedded chip id or city license number.</p>
<h2><a name="Titles">Titles</a></h2>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgNewDogTitles.gif" width="551" height="387"></p>
<p>This page is for recording an titles that you earn. After entering a title 
via a <a href="MenuMain.html#TitleNew">menu item</a> or the toolbar button
<img border="0" src="images/ToolbarNewTitle.gif" width="18" height="17">, you will be 
taken to this page.</p>
<p>The <b>View Hidden</b> option (also available on the main 
<a href="MenuMain.html#ShowHiddenTitles">View-&gt;Show Hidden 
Titles</a> menu), allows you to hide titles you no longer want to see. There are 
two occasions you may want to hide a title:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The title has been superceded by a later title. For instance, earning your 
  MX in AKC implies that you have earned your AX.</li>
  <li>The title is one you will never earn. For instance, if you started 
  competing in USDAA prior to 2004 and are currently in Masters, you will never 
  earn the new game titles.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you create a new title using the <b>New</b> button, or edit an existing 
entry with the <b>Edit</b> button (double-clicking on an entry will also edit 
it), you will be taken to the <a href="DlgTitle.html">Title dialog</a>.</p>
<p>If you notice the column headers, you may think they look a little strange. 
The &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; symbols denote a descending or ascending sort. The number in 
parentheses denotes the sort order. This applies to any lists you see that have 
this appearance.</p>
<h2><a name="Registration">Registration Numbers</a></h2>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgNewDogRegNum.gif" width="551" height="387"></p>
<p>The Registration Numbers pane is used to enter all the registration numbers 
you have for the various venues. This number will be listed in the Points view. 
When you create a new entry or edit an existing one, you will be taken to the
<a href="DlgRegNum.html">Registration Number dialog</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="Existing">Existing Points</a></h2>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgNewDogExistingPts.gif" width="551" height="387"></p>
<p>Existing Points allow you to create a dog in Agility Record Book who has been 
competing for a while without the need to enter all of their runs. Typically, 
the points generated in the Points view are based only on runs that Agility 
Record Book knows about. If you have a dog with 200 runs, you may not want to 
enter all that data! This pane allows you to tell Agility Record Book about 
points you have already earned.</p>
<p>Clicking the <b>New</b> or <b>Edit</b> buttons will take you to the
<a href="DlgExistingPoints.html">Existing Points dialog</a>.</p>
