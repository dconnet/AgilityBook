<h1>Event Configuration Dialog</h1>
<p>The Event Configuration dialog is probably the most complicated of the
configuration dialogs. This is used to define various combinations of divisions
and levels for which this event is valid. Sometimes only one method is required,
though often scoring is done differently at the different levels.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgConfigEvent.gif"></p>
<p>The <b>Name</b> is a unique name identifying this event. The <b>Event Note</b>
is a description that applies to the event as a whole.</p>
<p>The two checkboxes, <b>Has Table?</b> and <b>Has Partners?</b> describe
certain aspects of this event. Enabling the table option will allow this run
adjust the Yards Per Second in the <a href="PropRun.html">Run Properties</a>.</p>
<p>The <b>Has Sub-Names?</b> checkbox is used when a particular event may
actually be composed of several variations. See <a href="#subnames">below</a>
for more details.</p>
<p>The order of scoring methods is very important. When attempting to find a
scoring method for a division/level, the first item that is matched will be
used. So if the &quot;&lt;All&gt; / &lt;All&gt;&quot; method were first, no other method would ever be
used.</p>
<p>When this dialog is brought up for a new event, the first thing you must do
(after setting the above information), is to create a new scoring method with
the <b>New</b> button. This will create a method for all divisions and levels.
If you need to refine that (as with the example above), edit the entry by doing
one of the following actions:
<ul>
<li>Clicking the <b>Edit</b> button.</li>
<li>Double clicking the Scoring Method.</li>
<li>Double clicking in the box containing the description of the scoring method.</li>
</ul>
This will bring up the following dialog.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgConfigEventMethod.gif"></p>

<p>Use the <b>Division</b> and <b>Level</b> controls to select what this
method is for.
You can use the <b>Copy</b> button (previous dialog) to copy an existing scoring
method - this is convenient when different methods vary only a little.</p>
<p>The <b>Valid From</b> and <b>Valid To</b> fields enable scoring methods to
change. For instance, in 2004 USDAA introduced titling programs for the Novice
and Advanced levels. In the dialog below, you can see how the number of methods
increases! (This is also where the <b>Copy</b> button was very convenient!)</p>

<p>The <b>Scoring Style</b> affects what other controls will be visible. As you
can see, this dialog differs slightly from the first example. The available
scoring styles are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Faults Then Time</b> - Lowest number of faults wins, ties are broken
  by time.</li>
  <li><b>100 Minus Faults Then Time</b> - Score closest to 100 wins, ties are
  broken by time.</li>
  <li><b>200 Minus Faults Then Time</b> - Score closest to 200 wins, ties are
  broken by time.</li>
  <li><b>Opening/Closing Points Then Time</b> - The sum of points earned during
  the opening and closing periods wins, ties are broken by time.</li>
  <li><b>Points Then Time</b> - Greatest number of points wins, ties are broken
  by time. This differs from the above in that it doesn't matter if the points
  were earned during an opening or closing period.</li>
  <li><b>Time Plus Faults</b> - The lowest score when time and faulted points
  are combined, wins. Note, this style does not compute time faults, unless
  specifically enabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>For each of the scoring styles, there are a number of options that can be set:</P>
<ul>
  <li><b>Time Fault Multiplier</b> - Generate additional faults for any time
  faults (AKC uses this).
  [Faults Then Time,
  100 Minus Faults Then Time,
  200 Minus Faults Then Time,
  Time Plus Faults]</li>
  <li><b>Time+Fault runs must be clean to Q</b> - Time+Fault runs are normally
  scored by adding the time and faults. In some venues, this is used for
  placing, however the run must be clean to actually qualify.
  [Time Plus Faults]</li>
  <li><b>Subtract time faults from score</b> - When computing how many points
  were earned, subtract any time faults from the score. For example, this is
  used in AKC FAST and CPE FullHouse.
  [Opening/Closing Points Then Time,
  Points Then Time]</li>
  <li><b>Compute time faults under SCT</b> - Compute time faults if you are
  actually under the course time. This is used in Time Gamble type runs.
  [Opening/Closing Points Then Time,
  Points Then Time,
  Time Plus Faults]</li>
  <li><b>Compute time faults over SCT</b> - Compute time faults if you are
  over the course time. This is used in some Gamble type runs, AKC FAST and
  CPE FullHouse.
  [Opening/Closing Points Then Time,
  Points Then Time,
  Time Plus Faults]</li>
</ul>
<p>The <b>Drop time fractions for faults</b> option is used when computing
time faults - any fractions are dropped.</p>
<p>The <b>Has Bonus Points</b> option applies only to NADAC runs (at the
present).
This is used to identify runs where a Bonus Box may be available allowing
the dog to earn 15 title points if done successfully.</p>
<p>The <b>Has Super Qs</b> option is for USDAA Snooker.
It means you qualified in the top 15% of the class.
Agility Record Book will not compute this for you.
This is so this option could be used in other venues for similar purposes,
even though the percentage may be different.</p>
<p>The <b>Has Speed Points</b> option applies only to AKC runs (at the present).
Speed Points (in AKC, they are known as Mach Points) are computed as the
number of whole seconds below Standard Course Time.</p>
<p>Associated with Speed Points are the <b>Speed Point Placement Multipliers</b>.
When a dog finishes a run with one of the listed placements, the number of
Speed Points earned is multiplied by the listed Multiplier.
If an entry is created with a place of <b>0</b>, then that multiplier will
be applied to all entries not specifically listed. (Note, when entering
a Place in the Runs dialog, the zero entered there is not the same has the 0
entered here. Entering 0 there will not cause the 0-Multiplier to be applied.)
This special entry could allow you to configure an entry so that only the
listed places generated Speed Points (by setting the Multipler value to 0.0).
Speed Point Multipliers are modified in the following dialog:
<br/><img border="0" src="images/DlgConfigEventPlacement.gif"></p>

<p>The <b>Title Points</b> section shows how many title points you can earn,
based on the number of faulted points incurred.
In both examples above, you must run clean.
In NADAC (and others), you can still qualify if you, for instance, drop a
bar, but the number of titling points you earn is less. In that case, you would
have multiple entries in this section. The &quot;<b>#</b>&quot; that you see in the
example above means that these titling points also are accumulated in a lifetime
total. In this section, the order of entries is determined by the number of
faulted points.
You cannot create two entries that have the same number of faulted points.</p>
<p>When you create or edit a Title Points entry, the following dialog will be
displayed:</p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="images/DlgConfigTitlePoints.gif"></p>
<p>The <b>Faults Allowed</b> field allows you to specify what the maximum number
of faulted points you can incur and still qualify is.
The <b>Points</b> is the number of points you will earn.
<b>Normal</b> is one of three types of points this may be.
The other two are Lifetime and Placement points.
Lifetime points are accumulated across
all divisions, levels and events and displayed in the main
<a href="TabPoints.html">Points View</a>.
Placement points are points you earn specifically for placing.
These are currently used in FCI and FCI-related venues.</p>
<p>Note: If you can qualify in an event and that event has lifetime points, you
must create two entries in the <b>Title Points</b> section (as the dialog above
shows for USDAA Masters Snooker).
The existence of a Lifetime point entry does <i>not</i> imply titling points.
If you do not have a titling point entry, the <b>Q?</b> control in dialog
to create a run will be disabled since the assumption is made that if there
are no titling points available, then you cannot Qualify in that event.
This is useful when you want to create an event for tracking fun-runs.</p>
<h1><a name="subnames">Sub Names</a></h1>
<p>An event is configured for sub-names when multiple variations of the event
exist. An example of these are NADAC's Gamblers class and the game classes in
TDAA. In the NADAC example, we know all the sub-names to start with, so we can
pre-configure the program with them. In TDAA, games are not pre-defined. So,
we can list some initial ones, however the user must be able to enter names
of new events without the need to modify this configuration. In TDAA, we will
create a generic events that the user can add to.</p>
