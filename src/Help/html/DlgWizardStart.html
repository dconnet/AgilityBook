<h1>Import / Export Wizard</h1>
<p>The Import Export Wizard allows you to import or export data from/to either a 
spreadsheet or another Agility Record Book file. The options available between 
the spreadsheet and Agility Record Book formats are slightly different, as you 
can see from the dialogs.</p>

<p>When you select in entry in the list, a description will be displayed on the 
right describing what will happen. When exporting for a spreadsheet, you need to
<a href="DlgWizardExport.html">specify the format</a>. Also, when you import 
from a spreadsheet, you also need to <a href="DlgWizardImport.html">specify the 
format</a>.</p>

<p>When importing and exporting in the Agility Record Book format, the only 
additional information you need to supply is the name of the file.</p>
