<h1>Points</h1>
<p>The Points tab is made up of one main window.
Depending on the <a href="DlgOptionsPgm.html">options</a> set, this window
will have one of two appearances: a list or html.</p>
<p>The list looks like:<br/>
<img border="0" src="images/TabPoints.gif"><br/>
If you right-click on an item (or press the "Window Menu" key on the keyboard),
a <a href="MenuPoints.html">context menu</a> will appear 
allowing you to perform a number of actions.</p>
<p>The html view looks like:<br/>
<img border="0" src="images/TabPoints2.gif"><br/>
This window also has a context menu, but it is the normal one you will find
in a web browser.
In order to perform any of the actions you might find in the list's context
menu, you must either click on a link in the html or select a menu item from
the main menu.</p>
<p>The following comments apply to both variants of this view.</p>
<p>This window only presents information to you.
You can adjust what is visible by modifying the
filter in the <a href="DlgOptionsFilter.html">viewing preferences</a>.</p>
<p>One thing to note about the view preferences: Only the venue and date
portions of the filter apply to this view.
The Qualifying status of runs is ignored.
This is done in order to compute the qualifying rate.
Since this view is designed to show how many points you have earned,
it doesn't make much sense to use the qualifying status of the filter!</p>
<p>There is some additional information that can be accessed in this view.
In the Html-style window, lines with additional information are obvious since
they have a familiar link to follow. In the List-style window, you must either
double-click the line, or use the keyboard and press either space or enter to
view the current line.
<ul>
<li>Dog: Brings up the <a href="PropDog.html">dogs property dialog</a>.</li>
<li>Venue: Brings up the dogs property dialog with on the Registration Numbers
tab. (Html-style: The link on the registration number will do this, the link
on the venue name will start a new instance of Internet Explorer with the
venue's website.)</li>
<li>Title: Brings up the <a href="DlgTitle.html">title properties</a>.</li>
<li>Runs, Multiple-Q, Other Points: Brings up a dialog similar to this:<br/>
<img border="0" src="images/DlgPointsDetails.gif"><br/>
[If you press the <b>Copy</b> button,
it will copy all the data in this dialog to the clipboard in a tab delineated
style suitable for pasting into a spreadsheet.]</li>
<li>LifeTime Points: Brings up a dialog listing how many
points at each level using the prior dialog with
Division, Level and Points columns.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Note: Not all lines in the List-style Points view have details.
If you attempt to open one that does not, it will beep at you.</p>
