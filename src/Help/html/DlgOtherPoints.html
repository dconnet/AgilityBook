<h1>Other Points Dialog</h1>
<p>The Other Points dialog allows you to create or edit other points you
may have earned that are not directly recognized by Agility Record Book.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgOtherPoints.gif"></p>
<p>This dialog allows you to select a pre-configured Other Points. Simply fill 
in the number of points you have earned. Each time you change the Other Points 
in the list, the description below it will be updated.</p>
<p>If you need to create Other Points for an item that is not listed (for 
instance, breed points), you must first create an entry using the
<b>New</b> button. This will run the 
<a href="DlgConfig.html#OtherPoints">configuration dialog</a>.
