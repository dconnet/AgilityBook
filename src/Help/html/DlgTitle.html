<h1>Title Dialog</h1>
<p>The Title dialog allows you to create or edit a title.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgTitle.gif"></p>
<p>The <b>Earned</b> checkbox denotes that you have actually earned this title.</p>
<p>The <b>Hide this title</b> checkbox allows you to hide a title. This can be 
convenient when you have earned a higher level title, for instance an AKC MX 
title means you have already earned the NA, OA and AX titles.</p>
<p>The Venue list contains all currently configured venues. Once you have 
selected a venue, the titles that can be earned in that venue will then be 
displayed.</p>
<p>The <b>Received</b> checkbox allows you to specify that you have actually 
received the title certificate.</p>
<p>Hiding works very well for titles that you cannot earn. For instance, when 
USDAA created the new Novice and Advanced titles, any dog currently in Masters 
could not earn that title. So by creating an entry for that title and unchecking 
Earned and checking Hide, that then removes the title from the list of titles to 
select from in the future.</p>
