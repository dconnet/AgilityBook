<h1>File Management Issues</h1>
<h2><a name="Updates">Checking for updates</a></h2>
<p>Agility Record Book has the ability to see if there is a newer version of 
itself available. This can be done thru the
<a href="MenuMain.html#CheckforUpdates">main menu</a>, the
<a href="DlgAbout.html">About dialog</a>, or <a href="DlgOptionsPgm.html">
automatically</a>. When Agility Record Book finds that there is a newer version 
available, it will ask you if you would like to download it. Answering yes will 
cause a web page to be started pointing at a location where you can download the
program. Agility Record Book will not automatically download or install 
anything. It leaves that up to you. (Note, once you download the program, you 
must then run the installation to actually update it.)</p>
<p>In addition, if the program is currently up to date, the configuration will
be checked. If a newer version is available on the web, you will be prompted
to upgrade. Unlike the check above that only guides you to the location to get
the update, this check will actually do the upgrade. Once the program has
actually performed the update check, it will then check each file you open
to see if the configuration within that file is up-to-date. The check during
file open never accesses the internet, it only checks previously cached
information</p>
<p>Also, see <a href="DlgOptionsPgm.html">Options dialog</a> for information
about configuring the automation of these items.</p>
<h2><a name="Multiple">Multiple files or multiple dogs</a></h2>
<p>When you have multiple dogs, you have a choice as to whether you want all the 
dogs in one file, or whether you want multiple files. In many ways it is easier 
if both dogs are in one file - then when you create a trial, you can create it 
for both dogs at the some time. However if you run one dog and your Significant 
Other runs another, you may want to keep separate files. It all depends on your 
relationship and how each of you records the data for your dogs!</p>
<p>If you elect to keep the dogs in separate files, it is easy to switch back 
and forth. On the main <b>File</b> menu, the most recently opened files are 
listed near the bottom. Simply select an entry there and that file will be 
opened.</p>
<h2><a name="Moving">Moving a file to a different machine</a></h2>
<p>Usually moving the .ARB file to another machine is a simple matter of copying 
the single file. However, if you have linked any files in the
<a href="PropRun.html">Run Properties dialog</a>, you need to also copy those 
files. To do this, invoke the <b>File -&gt; File all linked files</b> menu item. If 
you have any links, the <a href="DlgFindLinks.html">Linked File dialog</a> will 
appear. You can now copy each of those files to the other machine also.</p>
<p>As a side-note to this, if you move or delete any of the linked files, you 
should update those links in your file. Just find all the links as above, and 
Edit them to point to the new location. Or remove them if they no longer exist.</p>
