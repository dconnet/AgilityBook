<h1>Runs</h1>
<p>The Runs tab is made up of two main windows. The view on the left is 
known as the Tree, the one on the right is the Runs list.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/TabRuns.gif"></p>
<p>When you select a run in the tree, the run will also be 
highlighted in the right side. The view that currently has focus will have the 
selected item drawn more visibly (in the above picture, the left view has 
focus).</p>
<p>The icons in the Tree represent different things. For a Dog, the icon is
simply a dog's head <img border="0" src="images/ToolbarNewDog.gif">.
For a Run, the icon is a couple of agility obstacles
<img border="0" src="images/ToolbarNewRun.gif">.
For a trial, the first icon (which will be either blank or a check mark)
shows whether the trial's data has been verified.
The second icon represents the venue.
If the venue is not a pre-configured venue, the icon used will be the same
as the toolbar icon for creating a new trial
<img border="0" src="images/ToolbarNewTrial.gif">.</p>
<p>If you right-click on an item (or press the &quot;Window Menu&quot; key on the 
keyboard), one of 3 (<a href="MenuDog.html">dog</a>, <a href="MenuTrial.html">
trial</a>, <a href="MenuRuns.html">run</a>) different context menus will appear 
allowing you to perform a number of actions. (In the 'Runs' list, the <a href="MenuRuns.html">run</a> menu will appear.)</p>
<p>Also, double-clicking on an item (in either window), will bring up one of 3 (<a href="PropDog.html">dog</a>,
<a href="PropTrial.html">trial</a>, <a href="PropRun.html">run</a>) different 
dialogs (the <b>Properties</b> item in the context menu will do the same thing).</p>
