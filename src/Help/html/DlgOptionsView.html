<h1>Viewing Options</h1>
<p>The Viewing option page is used to set the fonts you wish to use when
printing and various Calendar options.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgOptionsView.gif" width="551" height="481"></p>
<p>The <b>Set Font</b> button in the <b>Printing</b> section will allow you to
set the font that will be used for all views (except the Calendar View) when
printing.</p>
<p>The <b>Calendar List</b> section allows you to modify how entries appear in
the list when they have an opening and/or closing date and you have marked that
you are going to enter them.</p>
<ul>
	<li>When &quot;Warn when the Opening date is near&quot; is enabled,
	entries that you are planning on entering will be displayed in the
	specified color when the current date is within the given range.</li>
	<li>When &quot;Warn when the Closing date is near&quot; is enabled,
	entries that you are planning on entering will be displayed in the
	specified color when the current date is within the given range.</li>
</ul>
<p>The remaining items pertain to the <b>Calendar View</b>.</p>
<p><b>First day of the week</b> allows you can change which day of the week
should appear at the start of each line.</p>
<p>Once a date has passed, the old entry can either be hidden or deleted. In
either case, you can configure the program to define how much time should pass
before an entry is considered past. Setting this value too low can make it
difficult if you wish to create a trial directly from the calendar entry.</p>
<p>The <b>Hide entries on dates where you've entered a trial</b> is convenient
for hiding trials that you will not be entering. It helps keep the calendar
from being too cluttered.</p>
<p><b>View Opening dates</b> will add the opening date onto the calendar for any
entries that have an opening date and are marked that you are planning on
entering them. Similarly, closing dates are added onto the calendar when <b>View
Closing dates</b> is set. If planned-on entries are filtered, opening and
closing dates will be filtered also.</p>
<p>The <b>Calendar Entries</b> combobox contains five entries: &quot;Not
Entered&quot;, &quot;Planning&quot;, &quot;&nbsp; Opening&quot;,
&quot;&nbsp; Closing&quot;, &quot;Entered&quot;. The <b>Set Color</b>
button that follows allows you to set the color for the currently selected item.
When you change the combobox selection, the area to the right will show a
preview of what an entry will look like.</p>
<p>The size entries allow you to set how big the calendar entry should be. As
soon as you enter a number (and shift focus to another control), the preview
area will update.</p>
<p>Finally, the <b>Set Font</b> button in this section will set the font used in
the Calendar View.</p>
<p>All options are saved into the local Windows Registry.</p>
