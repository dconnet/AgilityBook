<h1>Miscellaneous Tasks</h1>
<h2><a name="MoveRun">Moving a run</a></h2>
<p>If you wish to move a run from one trial to another, or to a different dog, 
the only way that is currently supported is via the clipboard. Select the item 
you wish to move in the <a href="TabRuns.html">main tree</a> and copy (or cut) 
it using either a <a href="Keyboard.html">keyboard shortcut</a>, the
<a href="MenuRuns.html">context menu</a>, or the <a href="MenuMain.html#Copy">
main menu</a>. Then select the trial you wish to move the run to and paste it, 
again with either a keyboard shortcut, context menu or the main menu.</p>
<h2><a name="DT">Entering a USDAA Dog Agility Master Tournament event</a></h2>
					<p align="left">To create a DAM Event in USDAA:</p>
					<ul>
                      <li>
					<p align="left">Create the Standard and Gamblers events 
                    using the &quot;Tournament&quot; level.</li>
        <li>
					<p align="left">Create the Snooker and Jumpers events using 
                    the level you are currently competing at. (You may create 
                    them under the Tournament level, but when viewing the total 
                    points on the 'Points' tab, you will need to add the 
                    individual categories to get the total number of legs you 
                    have earned.)</li>
        <li>
					<p align="left">Create the 3-dog relay under the &quot;Pairs&quot; 
                    event in the &quot;Tournament&quot; level.</li>
    <li>
					<p align="left">For the individual events, I enter my 
                    placement. In the comments section, I note how the team did. 
                    You may do either - though if I ever implement automatic 
                    Super-Q detection, you will want your individual results 
                    entered. For the Pairs (relay) event, I enter how the team 
                    did overall and list the individual relay status in the 
                    comments.</li>
</ul>
					<p align="left">By doing the above, your points will 
                    accumulate correctly in the relevant categories.</p>
					<p align="left">The Configuration is setup so that Standard 
                    and Gamblers events in the Tournament class have no titling 
                    points. Similarly, Snooker and Jumpers do have titling 
                    points, since these runs also count towards your normal 
                    titles. Though, as I note above, you probably don't want to 
                    enter them under Tournament - it just makes figuring out how 
                    many legs you have actually earned a little more difficult.</p>
<h2><a name="Top10">Entering USDAA Top-10 Points</a></h2>
					<p align="left">Currently, Agility Record Book does not 
                    automatically track Top-10  points. However, it 
                    is very simple to help it! When entering a run, 
                    click on the 'Other Points' button and add an entry there. 
                    [Top-10 points are already configured as 'Other Points' in the program.]</p>
					<p align="left">If you want to track any other type of 
                    points that are not already configured (for instance Breed 
                    points), select the <b>Edit-&gt;Configuration</b> menu item to 
                    bring up the <a href="DlgConfig.html#OtherPoints">Configuration editor</a>. 
                    See the Configuration for more details.</p>
					<h2><a name="CoSanction">Creating a co-sanctioned trial</a></h2>
<p>A co-sanctioned trial is created simply by creating more than one hosting 
club in the <a href="PropTrial.html#Club">Trial properties</a>. See the Trial 
properties for more details.</p>
