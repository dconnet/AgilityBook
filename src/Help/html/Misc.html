<h1>Miscellaneous Tasks</h1>
<h2><a name="MoveRun">Moving a run</a></h2>
<p>If you wish to move a run from one trial to another, or to a different dog,
the only way that is currently supported is via the clipboard. Select the item
you wish to move in the <a href="TabRuns.html">main tree</a> and copy (or cut)
it using either a <a href="Keyboard.html">keyboard shortcut</a>, the
<a href="MenuRuns.html">context menu</a>, or the <a href="MenuMain.html#Copy">
main menu</a>. Then select the trial you wish to move the run to and paste it,
again with either a keyboard shortcut, context menu or the main menu.</p>
<h2><a name="DT">Entering a USDAA Dog Agility Master Tournament event</a></h2>
<p align="left">To create a DAM Event in USDAA:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p align="left">Create all team events
		using the &quot;Tournament&quot; level unless...
	</li>
	<li>
		<p align="left">If Snooker and/or Jumpers offer titling points,
		you should enter these using the level you are currently competing
		at. Otherwise, your titling points will not reflect these runs.
	</li>
	<li>
		<p align="left">For the individual events, I enter my
		placement. In the comments section, I note how the team did.
		You may do either - though if I ever implement automatic
		Super-Q detection, you will want your individual results
		entered. For the Pairs (relay) event, I enter how the team
		did overall and list the individual relay status in the comments.
	</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Top10">Entering USDAA Top-10 Points</a></h2>
<p align="left">Currently, Agility Record Book does not
automatically track Top-10 points. However, it
is very simple to help it! When entering a run,
click on the 'Other Points' button and add an entry there.
[Top-10 points are already configured as 'Other Points' in the program.]</p>
<p align="left">If you want to track any other type of
points that are not already configured (for instance Breed
points), select the <b>Edit-&gt;Configuration</b> menu item to
bring up the <a href="DlgConfig.html#OtherPoints">Configuration editor</a>.
See the Configuration for more details.</p>
<h2><a name="CoSanction">Creating a co-sanctioned trial</a></h2>
<p>A co-sanctioned trial is created simply by creating more than one hosting
club in the <a href="PropTrial.html#Club">Trial properties</a>. See the Trial
properties for more details.</p>
<h2><a name="NADACgamblers">Entering a NADAC Gamblers run</a></h2>
<p>Starting in 2004, NADAC started changing the way Gamblers is run. Agility
Record Book can handle the new class with the existing configuration:</p>
<ul>
	<li>When entering a run, set the number of required opening and closing
	points to zero.</li>
	<li>Set the number of points earned in the opening and closing to zero.</li>
	<li>Set the time to zero.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only information that is of any interest (other than the date, division,
and level) is whether or not you qualified. All the other fields can be ignored.
Starting in 2005, these fields will automatically have zero as the default
values (when you use the current configuration).</p>
<p>When you run the combined Regular/Gambler run, you must actually create two
separate entries in Agility Record Book for the information to be correctly
tabulated. One of the central ideas the program was built on was that for any
given run, you can only earn points in one event (with the exception of the
Other Points entries).</p>
<p>Speaking of which, you could enter the Gamblers points in a Regular run by
creating a &quot;NADAC Gambler&quot; Other Point object and then setting those Other
Points in the Regular run. This is not the recommended way since the points
would no longer be tabulated in the NADAC section in the Points View. Nor would
they be accumulated in the lifetime points.</p>
