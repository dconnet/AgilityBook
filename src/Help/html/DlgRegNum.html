<h1>Registration Number Dialog</h1>
<p>The Registration Number dialog allows you to create or edit a registration number for a configured venue.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgRegNum.gif"></p>
<p>The only venues that can be selected are ones that are currently configured. 
The Registration Number and Measured Height fields are free-form text - you can 
enter any data you wish. For instance, my USDAA height is listed as 
&quot;18.875-19.25&quot; to show the range of measured heights.</p>
<p>The <b>Height Card Received</b> checkbox is used for your information - you 
can track which cards you have currently received. This is useful when you are 
first starting out if you plan on showing in multiple venues.</p>
