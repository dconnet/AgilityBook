wxWidgets-2.8.12\fr.po file originated in <wx>/locale/fr.po, copied here, edited
in poedit to change charset to utf8 and set the catalog language properly.
Also changed 'plural-forms' to 'Plural-Forms' to make poedit happy.

trunk\fr.po is from <wx>/locale/fr.po, copied here and converted to unix-eol.
