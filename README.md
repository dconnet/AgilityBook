About

Agility Record Book is a free and open source program for tracking
your dog's progress in a variety of agility venues. (Though I do ask
that you make a donation to a local animal shelter or rescue group).

Note: I can really use some help when rules change. Just send me a note.
Or if you're adventuresome, modify the configuration in the program and send
me a copy of that. (Or submit a pull request!) In some cases, the program
won't be able to support what is needed - but we can fix that!

History
-------

Agility Record Book started as a humble Excel spreadsheet, but that
quickly grew too complicated since I wanted it to automatically calculate
many things. And with all the rule differences between the venues,
the macros were complex and data entry was a pain! Thus AgilityBook was
born on December 28, 2002. With the help of many people in the
[Yahoo discussion group](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/AgilityRecordBook),
various options were debated, added, and tested. In July of 2003,
I officially released the source code into the public domain on Source Forge.
This was then moved to GitHub at the end of December 2017.

Platforms
---------

Agility Record Book currently supports:

- Windows XP and higher (32/64 bit)
- MaxOS 10.7 and higher (64 bit)

The binaries for the platforms above can be found in
[Releases](https://github.com/dconnet/AgilityBook/releases).

In theory, it should be able to be compiled on any platform that is supported by
[wxWidgets](http://wxwidgets.org/).
See [Readme-Build.txt](https://github.com/dconnet/AgilityBook/blob/master/Readme-Build.txt)
for more information on building the source code.
