Notes for releasing a new version.

Files to change before marking files for release:
- Update the version build number (per instructions in VersionNumber.h)
- Make sure 'configure.in' is updated with the version number.
  - Note: Version numbers are auto-changed via src/Include/SetBuildNumber.py
    This is automatically run in the VC9 project - so always build VC9 first
    when doing a release.
- If file version has changed:
  - Update comments in src/Win/res/AgilityRecordBook.dtd (update website too)
  - Update the version in DefaultConfig.xml
  - Plus: Make sure that the Update() methods have been updated!
    If this is missed, the new data will not be merged.
- If configuration has changed:
  - Same as file version changing above
- Update CD Label (SureThing CD Labeler Deluxe v3.12)
- History.txt
  Update program version and date, along with any comments.
  - Reflect these changes into help/html/HistoryData.html
  - Run "src\UpdateHistory.py -h"
    (note: while a help file is no longer actually generated, continue doing
    this as the website pulls it's data from this too. And at some point, I
    may reinstate the help file)
- Todo.txt
  Any necessary changes...

Run Doxygen and fix any warnings/errors it reports.
- cd ...\AgilityBook
- doxygen AgilityBook.dox

Do a full rebuild and verify it.
- cd src\Projects\Installer
- BuildAll.bat [runs VC9 compile]
- Run 'GenMSI.py /all' to create w32/x64 installers and auto-update
  Misc\Installations\InstallGUIDs.csv
  - Copy .msi files to \AgilityBook\distrib\vN.N.N.N, zip them.
- The VC7 and VC8 versions should also be built just to make sure they work.

Commit all changes to SVN.

Pull files onto Mac and build there (see MAC_BUILD.txt)
- export PATH=$WXWIN/build-ansi:$PATH
- cd .../AgilityBook
- autoconf
- cd build
- ../configure
- make dist
[note: the makefile is not generating the image correctly to run on osx10.4
So do a release build in xcode and copy that executable into the 'dist'
generated .app folder]
- Use the '/Application/Utilities/Disk Utility' to create a dmg file
  - Name it AgilityBook-n_n_n_n-mac.dmg
  - After dragging in image, rename the mount point.
  - Unmount and 'Convert' in DU (save as same name) to compress.

Tag SubVersion repository
 - https://agilitybook.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/agilitybook/tags/vn.n.n.n

Create the files to be distributed (make sure you archive them too)
- Any extra readme files required
- Copy a backup of released files to \AgilityBook\test\[vc7/vc8/vc9/vc9x64]
  Currently, I only archive vc9/x64 - the exe's that are released to the wild.
  [exe,dll,dat,lang/...]
- Clean out all build artifacts.
  - Everything under bin/...
  - Output files in Project/...
  - .aps/etc in src
- AgilityBook-n_n_n_n-src.zip
  - Remove all source control files from zip (just being clean)
  - Copy this to distrib\vN.N.N.N\
- Readme1st.vn.n.n.n.txt
  - Copy Misc/Instructions.txt to Readme1st.vn.n.n.n.txt and modify [if needed]

In SourceForge, enter the File Releases section in Admin.

  - AgilityBook-n_n_n_n-win-<lang>.zip

  - Update DTD

Prepare for next release:
