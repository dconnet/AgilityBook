Notes for releasing a new version.

Files to change before marking files for release:
- If file version has changed:
  - If major version has changed, make sure last part of pgm version agrees.
  - Update comments in src/Win/res/AgilityRecordBook.dtd (update website too)
  - Update the version in DefaultConfig.xml
  - Plus: Make sure that the Update() methods have been updated!
    If this is missed, the new data will not be merged.
- If configuration has changed:
  - Same as file version changing above
- Update CD Label (SureThing CD Labeler Deluxe v3.12)
- Update help\html\images\DlgAbout.gif
- History.txt
  Update program version and date, along with any comments.
  - Reflect these changes into help/html/HistoryData.html
  - Run "src\UpdateHistory.py -h"
- Todo.txt
  Any necessary changes...

Run Doxygen and fix any warnings/errors it reports.
- cd ...\AgilityBook
- doxygen AgilityBook.dox

Do a full rebuild and verify it.
- cd src\Projects\Installer
- BuildAll.bat [runs VC9 and VC8 compiles]
  [note: When this runs the post-build process in ParseResourceHeader to
  build the chm files, 'xcopy' is not recognized. So, after the script finishes,
  'cd ...\src; BuildHelp.py Release VC9Win32']
- Run 'GenMSI.py /all' to create w32/x64/w98 installers and auto-update
  Misc\Installations\InstallGUIDs.csv
  - Copy .msi files to \AgilityBook\distrib\vN.N.N.N, zip them.
- The VC6 and VC7 versions should also be built just to make sure they work.

Commit all changes to SVN.

Tag SubVersion repository
 - https://agilitybook.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/agilitybook/tags/vn.n.n.n

Create the files to be distributed (make sure you archive them too)
- Any extra readme files required
- Copy a backup of released files to \AgilityBook\test\[vc6/vc7/vc8/vc9/vc9x64]
  Currently, I only archive vc8/vc9/x64 - the exe's that are released to the wild.
- Clean out all build artifacts.
  - Everything under bin/...
  - Output files in Project/...
  - .aps/etc in src
- AgilityBook_n_n_n_n-src.zip
  - Remove all source control files from zip (just being clean)
  - Copy this to distrib\vN.N.N.N\
- Readme1st.vn.n.n.n.txt
  - Copy Misc/Instructions.txt to Readme1st.vn.n.n.n.txt and modify [if needed]

In SourceForge, enter the File Releases section in Admin.
- At the bottom of the page, 'Add Release' to 'agilitybook' package.
