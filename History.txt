08/28/2003: v0.4.3.5 <in development>
- New features / Enhancements:
  - Added a 'deceased' date to the dogs info. (This is a file version change but
    it is backwards compatible, so theres no need to increment the file version)
  - Finished implementing OtherPoints point tallying.
  - Optimized filtering, much faster now.
  - Added 'New dog/title/trial' items in the r-click menu of the Runs view.
  - Added a 'Filtered' item to the status bar.
  - Added Print & Print Preview in the Tree.
- Bug fixes
  - A change in 0.4.1.5 to compute the score on NQs was wrong - it computed the
    score on all runs and title points on NQ+Qs. It should only compute score
    on NQ+Q and title points on Qs. This only affected the run entry dialog and
    not the point accumulation view.
  - Cleaned up selection synchronization in the runs and calendar views.
    The trial run list selection now mirrors the tree selection.
  - Fixed bug where "ctrl+tab" didn't change tabs. "Shift+tab" was working.
  - In the calendar/faults/otherpts/partners dialog, set the selection when
    adding/deleting items.

08/16/2003: v0.4.2.5
- 7/23: Published source in sourceforge.net.
- New features / Enhancements:
  - Added printing for runs (not tree though), points and calendar list.
  - Removed automatic sorting of dogs - allow the user to set the ordering.
  - Added actual height and card received info to dog registration information.
  - When trying to cancel from the Run entry dialog, data verification prevented
    the cancel from occuring.
  - Added toolbar items for new dog/title/trial/run/calentry and print preview.
  - Added new options page for fonts, added font for printing, moved calendar
    fonts from calendar options page to this one.
  - In calendar view dialog (dbl-click,etc), show all entries for a date, even
    if the 'hide on entered' option is on.
- Bug fixes
  - Allow screen font selection for calendar printer items. Also the wrong
    font was displayed for the date on the printer.

07/16/2003: v0.4.1.5
- Bumped file version to 5:
  - Added 'Note' and 'Verified' to trials.
  - Changed 'Scoring' to have 'Note' and 'TitlePoints' subitems.
  - Added 'OpeningPts'/'ClosingPts' to event configuration.
  - Changed program version number to reflect file version.
- New features / Enhancements:
  - In Points: Changed the run totalling to be a little cleaner.
  - Reorganized options dialog.
  - Enhanced filtering to filter on divisions/levels.
  - Have the calendar start with the current day as the current selection.
  - Changed the way titling points are configured.
  - Changed calendar current day highlighting so you can tell when the view
    is active. Highlighting is based on system colors.
  - Automatically compute the score in the dog event dialog on both Q and NQ
    runs. Previously, it only computed on Qs.
  - When entering trial data, "remember" certain fields to make data entry
    easier. [Division, Level, Height, Handler, Judge]
  - Add opening points for gamblers/etc into configuration.
  - When errors are found when loading the data, the program attempts to keep
    going. It used to just quit and you would have no data.
  - Complete an "Update rules" mechanism to allow importing updated rules.
    This will merge changes. It will not delete entries in your configuration
    that are not in the new one, with one exception: Event scoring methods
  - Added performance pairs in USDAA (non-titling)
  - Added UKC.
- Bug fixes
  - Fixed date overlap test. If 2 date ranges only partially overlapped, the
    test was wrong. This resulted in calendar entries being visible when they
    shouldn't have been.
  - Copying the calendar data to the clipboard didn't insert a newline after
    the header.
  - From v0.3.0.1: If the viewing filter was enabled and you changed the
    venue of an existing trial, the trial continued to be visible even though
    the filter should have suppressed it.
  - The program didn't always prompt to save on close when something changed.
  - When creating new faults, they didn't show up in the list until after the
    run was saved.
  - The configuration 'Drop Fractions' setting wasn't properly applied.
  - If a level on a run is entered wrong (via hand-editing), that entry
    loaded with no warnings.

06/15/2003: v0.3.0.2
- Bumped file version to 4:
  - Added item to configuration scoring methods to drop fractional time faults.
  - Added a description to venues and events in the configuration.
- New features
  - Added CPE to default configuration.
  - Enable copy/paste of trials and runs.
  - Added filtering on multiple venues.
  - Tally points by level, not sublevel. Then things like NADAC
    Novice A/B add up in one place.
  - Points View: Tally Clean/Unclean Qs
- Bug fixes
  - Wasn't remembering the selected view between program invokations.
  - NewLine wasn't handled properly in Event Configuration dialog notes.
  - Editing an existing configuration Title failed with the message
    that it already exists. (divisions/levels/faults/otherpts too)

06/02/2003: v0.3.0.1: No longer calling releases alpha/beta/etc.
- Bumped file version to 3:
  - Add notes to configuration events specifically for USDAA DAM jumpers and
    snooker - the fact the "Q" there applies towards master legs and DAM relay
    Q implies the team qualified overall.
  - Moved Fault Types in configuration from Venue to global.
  - Moved Other Points in the same manner.
  - Added 'Received' field to Title.
- New features:
  - Create a trial entry from a calendar entry.
  - Add a delay factor to auto-delete of old calendar entries. (default: 5 days)
  - Allow runs (in tree) and faults (in run) to be reordered. Note, sometimes
    it will appear reordering fails. This will be due to sorting. For
    instance, runs and calendar entries are sorted by date, then reordering.
  - Added initial configuration updating. It will add any new entries, but
    will not yet update existing entries.
    [See a note in Todo.txt about updating venue configurations.]
- Minor enhancements:
  - Updated default USDAA config rules.
  - Tally the list of fault types like I do with judges. (You don't need to
    modify the configuration to have a new fault type show up in the selection
    list)
  - In points view, show the number of partners for Qs, not just total number
    of partners. When tallying the number of pairs partners, only 2-dog relays
    are tallied. This prevents some odd things when counting USDAA DAM
    tournament relays.
  - After creating a new dog/trial/run (via rclick menu), make that the selected
    item. (The wrong item was selected if you rclicked on an entry other than
    the current selection)
  - When entering a new run, the default date should be last date in the trial.
  - Modified calendar entry dialog to show trial opening/closing dates.
  - When an entry in the calendar list is selected, make calendar date in the
    right window pane selected too.
  - Added an 'edit' button to edit an existing registration num
  - Added an 'edit' button to edit an existing club
  - After inserting a trial/run in the tree, it was not properly sorted.
  - Add column sorting to reference runs.
  - Add option to reverse-sort trials and runs (newest first). This will also
    reverse the user re-ordering.
- Bug fixes:
  - Changing the Selected dog didn't update the points view.
  - Points view: QQ tallied wrong (it was double counting)
  - When venues are not filtered, ASCA pts were incorrectly totaled.
  - When modifying a configuration event, when a new div/level pair was
    created, the 'not defined' items weren't updated.
  - When an event is not qualifying (as defined in the configuration), the
    "q" list was still available when entering a run - not really an issue
    since it didn't get tallied.

04/03/2003: v0.2.0.3: Release Alpha5
Known issues: See the 'todo.txt' file.

02/23/2003: v0.2.0.2: Release Alpha4
- Modified default rules to add USDAA's Tournament classes.
  - If you have an existing file, the only way to get the new default rules
    is to hand edit. A future enhancement is to add an automated way of doing
    this. Currently: Create a new empty file and save it. Copy everything
    between "<Configuration>" and "</Configuration>" are replace the lines
    in your current file. Be careful!
- Minor bug fixes:
  - The date on a new run was occasionally 12/31/1969.
  - Made comboboxes for division and level wider in the RunEntry dialog.
  - Made the combobox for a new fault longer (so more are visible)
  - Made '0' the default from score in the reference run dialog.
  - In the 'Other Points' dialog, made the desc an edit field so it can scroll.
  - When modifying the configuration, the scoring methods were not updated.

- Calendar view:
  - Fixed problem where a new calendar entry didn't show up.
  - Created new view

  - Double clicking on a run now edits that entry.
- Run entry dialog
  - Titling points (mach/doubleQ) now appear correctly.
  - Enable/disable buttons properly.
  - Double-click on reference run now edits that entry.
- General:
  - Fixed all multi-line edit controls to auto-wrap correctly.

01/22/2003: v0.1.0.1: Release Alpha2
- 2nd alpha [vc6 only]
- Major data entry dialogs are complete.
- Main views on data are not. Program options still need implementing. Lots
  of outstanding tidbits.

- Second release [vc6&7] (still considering this the 1st alpha)
- Mainly just VC6 support due to some VC7 compatibility issues on older OSs.
