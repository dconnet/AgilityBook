    were marked as a Q (Fault/Time runs properly gave 0 title points).
  - Non-titling runs need ability to mark as E (NA or E)
  - Removing a lifetime point entry from the event configuration didn't
    always work.
  - Ranged event methods weren't probably filtered in Run dialog.
  - Subnames were enabled when they shouldn't have been.
  - The Notes dialog was not properly selecting the text for the related item.
  - Pasting (copy/paste) a dog into a new file required at least one dog to
    already exist.
  - When multiple runs are copied in the Runs list view, only one would paste.
  - When the 'Hide entries on dates where you've entered a trial' option is
    turned on and a Calendar entry that was marked as Entered was copied and
    pasted, both entries disappeared.

9/6/2005: v1.6.0.11
- Bumped file version to 11.0, Configuration v9:
  - Changed how double-Qs are tallied in order to support triple-Qs in UKC.
  - Fixed configuration for UKC.
  - Updated comments in configuration for NADAC (titling points) and
    USDAA (Grand Prix)
- New features / Enhancements:
  - Added color coding to calendar for entries that need attention.
  - Added ability to export Calendar entries to Outlook as appointments
    and/or tasks.
    - Added vCal/iCal export formats.
  - Remember the last entered height in the reference runs dialog.
  - Re-worked layout in Reference Run dialog to make it flow better.
  - Changed default Qing in Reference Run dialog to a 'Q' (was NA).
  - Added a button in the Reference Runs page to add yourself.
  - Remember the type of last import/export done.
  - Changed the term 'Double-Q' to 'Multiple-Q' to handle UKC's TripleQ.
  - When importing ARB files, update Registration Numbers and Titles that
    are different.
  - Split Options and Filters (F7). Added date filtering on calendar. The
    same date filter is applied to all items.
  - When a new version is detected, offer a choice of Yahoo or SourceForge
    to download from.
- Bug fixes
  - When multiple items are selected in the main list views, the right-click
    menu doesn't properly work on all the items.
  - When an error occured while reading a file, the error message was mangled.
  - Fixed a problem where the UI didn't reflect a change in the trial date
    ordering.
  - The wrong item in the tree was selected after reordering in the tree.
  - Added validation during import to make sure venue names are correct. It
    was possible to import bad data which, when we attempted to edit later,
    caused the program to crash.

6/11/2005: v1.5.4.10
- Bug fixes
  - Critical bug: Numbers with decimal points (34.21) were being rounded
    when saved, losing all precision.
  - Some numbers were being stored/shown in scientific notation. This was
    a visual issue only.

6/5/2005: v1.5.3.10
- Bumped file version to 10.2:
  - Added 'ver' to 'AgilityBook'.
- New features / Enhancements:
  - Made the hyperlinks on the About box accessible by keyboard.
  - Shifted dog's name one column in points view to help with column sizing.
  - Updated the F1 help on the Run dialog combo boxes.
  - Sub-total Lifetime points by division.
  - Add the ability to paste a CRCD course without the image (text only).
    This will help keep the .arb file size from becoming too bloated.
  - Changed how TrackPopupMenu is called so menu enabling works properly.
- Bug fixes
  - Accessing the Notes (club/judge/location) information dialog before any
    information exists caused the program to crash.
  - An entry added in the Notes dialog without a comment did not get saved.

3/29/2005: v1.5.2.10
- Bumped to Configuration v8:
  - Updated AAC titles.
- New features / Enhancements:
  - With multiple dogs, remember which ones were last selected.
  - Show a summary of lifetime points when double clicked in the Points view.
  - Cleaned up help a little (several dialogs caused an error message).
  - Renamed the 'Find' item under 'Notes' to 'Search Notes'.

2/10/2005: v1.5.1.10
- New features / Enhancements:
  - Added a link to the Yahoo group files section in the about box.
- Bug fixes
  - The rich-text edit control was not properly initializing on older Windows
    systems (like Win98). This caused several dialogs to not appear.

2/7/2005: v1.5.0.10
- Bumped file version to 10.1, Configuration v7:
  - Added 'underTF'/'overTF', 'timeFault' to 'Scoring'.
  - Added 'ClubInfo'/'LocationInfo' to 'Info'.
  - Renamed 'machPts' to 'speedPts'.
  - Added 'LongName' to 'Venue'.
  - Added 'SubName' to 'Event','Run','ExistingPoints'.
  - Added 'Multiple' to 'Titles', 'instance' to 'Title'.
  - Added CKC and TDAA.
  - Updated AAC (partially).
  - Changed NADAC Gamblers to use the new SubNames feature. The individual
    Gamblers events for Contacts/etc have been removed.
- New features / Enhancements:
  - Added the ability to make notes about clubs/locations similar to
    how judges notes are made. Also added the ability to search them.
  - In the club/judge/location dialog, added indicators to show if an item
    is added (not in-use) and/or has comments.
  - Flipped the order of 2 fields on the Run dialog it make more logical.
  - Enable duplication of a title in the configuration.
  - Added opening/closing dates to calendar view.
  - Changed the 'Show Newest Runs First' to sort only trials since
    sorting the runs is handled by the header in the Runs view.
  - Make F1 open context help from the main tab windows.
  - Renamed 'Mach points' to 'Speed Points' to make it more generic.
  - Added a long name to the venue configuration.
  - Added a SubName to an event so users can 'create' new events without
    the need to modify the configuration.
  - When you view run details in the Points view, also show existing points.
  - Added the ability to create MACH-2/NATCH-4(etc) titles.
  - Remember which field is sorted in the main views between program
    invocation.
- Bug fixes
  - Added a comment to USDAA/PD3 title about the old requirements.
  - Compute the score (in the run dialog) for NA runs that do not have
    titling points.
  - USDAA Time Gamble does not compute time faults.
    Added ability to compute time faults to Time+Fault style events.
  - When an event description has a newline in the configuration, the Run
    dialog shows a box instead.
  - Lifetime points were being filtered. Always show the total, but when
    filtering, also show what was earned in the filter.
  - Changes weren't saved when lifetime points in the configuration were
    modified.
  - Adding a judge that already exists in the information dialog resulted
    in a duplicate entry in the list. Closing the dialog and reopening it
    would clear up the problem.
  - Time faults are not properly computed in AKC in Open and Excellent.
  - Creating a title while in the Points view didn't mark the document as
    modified. This meant you could close the program and it would not prompt
    you to save it.

10/31/2004: v1.4.0.10
- Bumped file version to 10.0, Configuration v6:
  - Added 'Height' to 'ReferenceRun'.
  - Added 'LifeTime' to 'Scoring'.
  - Removed 'LifeTime' from 'TitlePoints'.
  - Added 'SCT', 'SCT2' to 'ByOpenClose'.
  - Added 'SCT' to 'ByPoints'.
- New features / Enhancements:
  - Updated CPE configuration to note that CL1 (thru 5) are not really titles.
    They are shorthand for the combined 4 titles. Also, make Level C runs
    accumulate lifetime points.
  - Added more Gamblers events for NADAC to handle the various 'styles'.
  - Added direct Excel import/export capability.
  - Added Mach points to the allowed columns in the runs view.
  - In the Calendar view, set the scroll amount to 4 weeks when you click
    on the scroll bar to page it.
  - Added the event description from the configuration to the dialog where
    a run is entered.
  - Added SCTs to gambler/snooker-style events. These are not used to
    compute anything, they are there just for reference.
  - Do not acculumate runs marked as NA in Point totals.
  - Added debug symbols to the installation to aid any problems that might
    be found during deployment.
  - Added error logging. If the program faults, it will now attempt to write
    a log file to the same location as the program. This will contain a stack
    trace and a dump of the current registry settings.
- Bug fixes
  - When a qualifying run is inserted in the tree and the tree is configured
    to show Qs for a run (via View->Customize), the program will crash.
  - The splash screen could cause a problem opening a file whose format is
    newer than the current program.
  - When the list viewer dialog is resized, the 'Copy' button doesn't move.
  - When switching options in the export wizard, the description gets out
    of sync.
  - Entering an incomplete run (either the time or SCT left at 0) and
    marking the run as a 'Q' would generate Mach points (obviously, way too
    many!). Also, if a run that was over-time was marked as a Q, the program
    generated a negative number of MACH points. In both cases, it should report
    zero points.
  - Lifetime points do not necessarily accrue at the same rate as titling
    points [CPE].

9/15/2004: v1.3.2.9
- Bug fix
  - If a trial has no clubs associated with it, attempting to upgrade the
    configuration will cause the program to crash. The work-around is to
    either add a club or delete the (empty) trial.
  - In some cases, when you create the first dog in a new file, it does not
    show up in the tree.

9/12/2004: v1.3.1.9
- Bug fix
  - My ISP host is no longer allowing direct access to files via
    agilityrecordbook.com since that actually forwards to another location.
    The URL must be properly qualified (meaning it points to comcast.net)

9/12/2004: v1.3.0.9
- Bumped Configuration v5:
  - Updated USDAA configuration to remove titling points from Tournament
    Jumpers and Snooker. Tournament runs that offered titling should be
    entered in the Div/Level they apply to.
  - Added Performance events for the Tournament runs (except Pairs) and
    Steeplechase. These are non-titling events, but many clubs are offering
    them now. Note, the name of the event will vary from club to club. We
    will just treat them as real runs. (If USDAA ever extends these events
    to Performance, then it will be easier to update.)
- New features / Enhancements:
  - Check for configuration updates when the user requests an update check.
    These are auto-downloaded from the web. Configuration checks are also
    done when a document is opened (but only if a previous check loaded the
    web information - opening a document will not access the web).
  - Added 'verified' option to trials in the tree (via column customization)
  - Added dbl-click support in the Points view to see the runs behind the data.
  - Enable the 'new title' toolbar button in the Points view.
  - Enable the merging (via Import) of Dogs, Trials, Runs, Judges.
  - Added an option to disable the splash screen.
  - Added tooltips in lists when columns are too small.
- Bug fixes
  - When updating the configuration, if they are the same but the version
    numbers are different, go ahead and update the version number.
  - If you dbl-clicked in some of the configuration dialogs when nothing was
    selected, the program faulted.
  - Existing other points were tallied in all existing other points entries.
    This resulted in too many points on the Points tab.
  - Up/Down sort icons on lists were backwards.
  - Changing the scoring type of an existing event did not ripple out to
    existing runs. This could cause a run to be stored with the wrong type
    so when it is read back in, the scoring type never got set - which then
    prevents the file from being saved again.
    - In 1.2.1.8, to recreate:
      - Create a new file, create a dog, create a trial.
      - Edit the configuration to change gamblers to faults/time.
      - Create a gamblers run.
      - Edit the configuration and change gamblers to open/close pts.
      - Save the file. Close it. Reopen it. This file can no longer be saved.
    Fix: When the scoring type of an event is changed, the program verifies
    that no runs are currently using that scoring type. If it finds runs are
    are using it, it will warn you that the runs will either be deleted or
    modified. Since the scoring method is being changed or deleted, there is
    no other option. As a user, you can choose not to merge the configuration.
  - Time+Faults scoring should not also compute time faults. You end up
    double-dinged when they are.
  - 'Reorder' menu item in the Runs view did nothing, disable it.

7/3/2004: v1.2.1.8
- Bug fixes
  - On some machines, the program would crash while coming up. The splash
    screen had threading problems.

7/3/2004: v1.2.0.8
- Bumped file version to 9.0, Configuration v4:
  - Added 'SubName' to 'Training'.
  - Moved 'RegNum' data to 'Number', data is now 'Note'
  - CPE 'CADE' changed to 'C-ATE'.
  - Updated NADAC Gambler configuration to handle new Gambler class.
- New features / Enhancements:
  - Integrated help system.
  - In the Points view, do not filter individual runs based on Qs (use all
    other filter criteria). This allows us to show a qualifying percentage.
  - Added the Dogs call name, registered name and current date to the top of
    the Points view (good when printing!).
  - Allow users to specify their own splash screen. Only .bmp files are
    supported (limited to Window's LoadImage API). Set in the Options dialog.
  - After adding a title, display the dog properties on title page. Change the
    behavior in the Options dialog to restore previous program behavior.
    (Too many people were having problems finding the title later.)
  - Added 'Sub-name' to the Training Log.
  - Added an 'Open' button to the 'Find Links' dialog.
  - Added status icons on the run dialog links page.
  - Added full support for cut/copy/paste of dog/run/calendar/log entries.
    Note, cut/copy is supported in the Run view, but paste is not. You can
    copy an entry there and then paste it in the proper place in the tree.
  - When you open a file that has no dogs, you will be prompted to create one.
  - When creating a trial from a calendar entry, copy the notes too.
  - Added the current dogs name to the status bar.
  - Added indicators for how the lists are sorted.
  - Added a note to a registration number.
- Bug fixes
  - Lifetime point accumulation did not display the points for existing runs.
  - Quote exported data so non-tab delimiters work properly if the delimiter
    character is actually part of the output data. Quotes are added if needed.
    Also, on import, handle quotes properly. Quoting is done like Excel.
  - Fixed \r\n line ends in OtherPoints configuration dialog.
  - When setting filter options on runs, it is possible that some runs may
    be visible when they shouldn't.
  - When filtering a dual-sanctioned trial, and the filtering options were
    different, a run would end up visible in the points view when it shouldn't.
    For instance, in an ASCA/NADAC trial, if you set filtering to hide Novice
    runs in NADAC and not ASCA, the novice runs were still visible under NADAC.
  - Fixed a problem in the Points View with accumulating non-qualifying runs
    when the filter was set to view only qualifying or only non-qualifying.

4/30/2004: v1.1.0.8
- Bumped file version to 8.6, Configuration v3:
  - Changed 'TableInYPS' to 'hasTable', added 'hasTable' to 'Scoring'
  - Added 'Link' to 'Runs'
  - Added 'LifeTime' to 'TitlePoints'
  - Updated configuration with lifetime point information.
- New features / Enhancements:
  - Instead of recording whether YPS should be adjusted for each run, just
    record if that run has a table. A new option (under 'View') then
    determines how to compute it. Old files will be auto-updated when the new
    configuration is merged, as long as it happens during startup.
  - Added Lifetime point accumulation information to USDAA and NADAC. Removed
    USDAA LAA from OtherPoints. Also, updated DAM and Steeplechase to accumulate
    LAA points from 1999 on.
  - Changed 'Insert Course' to 'Paste Course' in run dialog. (For clarity)
  - Added 'Links' in the run dialog and a corresponding 'Find Links' in the
    File menu.
  - Added simple sorting to the 3 main list views: Runs, CalendarList, Training
  - Create a backup file before saving.
  - Added a new page in the Options dialog for program options: number of
    backup files and auto-update-check.
  - Added 'Duplicate' menu item for trials/runs/calendar/training entries.
  - Added a splash screen at start and as a menu option. (This is a picture of
    Megan and me at the 2003 USDAA Nationals.)
    (Note for me: ARB font is 'FifthAve'/36pt)
  - In multi-dog files, remember the last dog viewed when opening the file.
  - When the program prompts to update the configuration when a file opens,
    just merge the default config instead of prompting.
- Bug fixes
  - When merging configuration information via the update feature, if only
    the description was changed in either a venue or an event, that
    information did not get properly merged.
  - The 'View->Show Hidden Titles' menu item was never enabled.
  - Fixed an inconsistency in pasting text from the clipboard. Sometimes the
    text was garbled when pasting into the CRCD text box.
  - The edit/delete buttons did not get enabled/disabled properly in the
    Reference Runs in the Runs dialog.
  - If opening a file for writing fails, the error message was wrong. (It
    reported on the minimum required resolution.)
  - If you imported a calendar listing that had a heading, but tried to parse
    the heading as an entry, the program faulted.
  - Fixed a problem encoding/decoding binary data. This affected pasting/viewing
    the CRCD image.
  - Some of the lists with sortable columns didn't properly remember their
    settings.
  - Changed how events are handled in the configuration dialog to prevent that
    weird memory access from happening.

3/21/2004: v1.0.4.8
- Bumped file version to 8.5:
  - Added 'isHidden' to 'Title'.
  - Made 'Date' optional in 'Title'.
- New features / Enhancements:
  - Changed Venue configuration slightly so it looks better (Divisions and
    Titles headers)
  - Added the ability to hide a title. This allows you to hide an old title
    or a title that you will never earn (for instance USDAA SSA, if you are in
    Masters already)
- Bug fixes
  - When creating a new run in a new trial, the date did not get saved if we
    didn't change it. This would only occur on the first run created and only
    if we didn't change the date (in other words, we entered the run on the
    day we ran it)
  - In the run dialog, the text on the table-in-yps was inverted. Instead of
    asking if you wanted to subtract for the table, it should have been asking
    it you wanted to include (pretty obvious when you watched the yps change
    after clicking the checkbox). In addition, it did not properly initialize
    when the event type was changed.

3/8/2004: v1.0.3.8
- Bumped file version to 8.4, Configuration v2:
  - Added table-in-yps flag (default is true for backwards compatibility)
  - Added new 'Configuration/Action' verb: DeleteTitle
  - Added 'version' to Configuration.
  - Added 'CRCDMeta' to Notes.
- New features / Enhancements:
  - Updated doxygen comments in ARB classes.
  - Added 'Check for Updates' on Help menu and About box.
  - Add a 5-sec table YPS computation checkbox in the runs.
  - Added the ability to tell if the program contains an updated config. When
    you open an old file, it will prompt to merge. Once you have updated, you
    will not be prompted again, even if you modify your config.
  - Added additional text to email message generated from hotlink in About box.
  - Added MetaFile support into CRCD dialog.
- Bug fixes
  - Creating a new document didn't clear the judge info from the previous doc.
  - The OtherPoints button in the runs dialog was improperly disabled at times.
  - Removed 'V-ATCH',etc from ASCA configuration.
  - Removed AMBOR Triple title abbreviations - titles are full text.

2/9/2004: v1.0.2.8
- Bumped file version to 8.3:
  - Added Existing Points to dog properties.
- New features / Enhancements:
  - Changed the Dog Property dialog to multiple tabs.
  - Added nice title names into the dog's property title page.
  - Updated dialog accelerators.
- Bug fixes
  - Updated NADAC Configuration with Novice/Open/Elite Triple Superior
    (mapped old 'Triple Superior' to 'Novice Triple...')
  - Updated ASCA Configuration with ATCHs.
  - Updated 2 CPE titles with long names.
  - Fixed a number of dialogs where data could be corrupted. (Note: In dialogs
    when using a DDX variable after the dialog returns, be careful about
    modifying it - CDialog::OnOK will force the UI data back into the variable)
  - When updating the configuration, you could get some false-positive messages
    that things had changed. This was due to the order of items being different
    (which we don't care about).
  - In the Run dialog
    - update the YPS when the time is changed.
    - update controls when date changes (in case different rules are in effect)
  - Fixed some crasher bugs in the configuration dialog when
    creating/modifying a venue.

1/26/2004: v1.0.1.8
- New features / Enhancements:
  - When starting the program, holding the SHIFT key down will prevent the
    last file from being automatically opened.
  - Redesigned Configuration dialog for ease-of-use.
- Bug fixes
  - Titles that were edited/created were saved with the wrong name. This caused
    the title to vanish after saving the file and re-opening it. [The fix will
    auto-correct the problem titles, if they are still in the file]

1/21/2004: v1.0.0.8
- Bumped file version to 8.2:
  - Added a new "Long Name" to the titles configuration.
  - Added 'Action' items to Configuration.
- New features / Enhancements:
  - Began distributing an MSVC7 msi installation.
  - Added AAC and AMBOR configurations.
  - Updated USDAA configuration.
  - GetAllClubs/Locations now includes calendar entries.
  - Implemented column customizing in Tree, Runs, Calendar and TrainingLog.
  - Added tooltips to headers when text is partially hidden.
  - Implemented importing from a spreadsheet.
  - Height is no longer a required field in a run.
  - The configuration and new title dialogs use the new long name (if available)
  - When renaming a title in the configuration and the new name already exists,
    ask the user if they actually want to merge the existing titles into that
    name. This allows us to change the name of a title non-destructively (though
    it requires some work on the users part to rename)
    - As an addition to this, added the ability to merge items when doing
      a configuration update.
- Bug fixes
  - Exporting the training log for import into a spreadsheet was wrong.
  - The points view didn't generate a venue header consistently if a venue
    had no titles.
  - When entering a run, too much validation was being done at the wrong time.
    (This could cause a 'Please enter an event' message when changing the date)
  - Total faults weren't updated when course faults changed.

12/28/2003: v0.9.5.8
- Bumped file version to 8.1:
  - Added 'ValidFrom' and 'ValidTo' dates to an events scoring method. This
    allows an evolution of rules while preserving point accumulation.
- New features / Enhancements:
  - Updated the initial support for the new USDAA titling (using ValidFrom/To)
    in the default configuration.
  - Added support for evolving rules in the configuration dialog. An event
    scoring method can be defined as being valid for a specific date range.
  - Changed how items are shown for export in the first wizard page
    (separated spreadsheet/ARB items).
  - Added more items to import/export.
    - SpreadSheet Export: Can now export Calendar/TrainingLog
    - ARB Import: Can now import TrainingLog
    - ARB Export: Can now export TrainingLog
  - Added some new accelerators:
    - Ctrl+E: Import/Export Wizard
    - Ctrl+F: Find (Find does not work in the points or calendar view)
    - F3: Find Next
    - Shift+F3: Find Previous
    - Ctrl+J: Judge's comments dialog
    - Ctrl+R: Create a new run
    - F7: Viewing options dialog
    - F12: Save As
  - Added a basic Find function. It is context sensitive to the active view.
- Bug fixes
  - Training log didn't re-sort if you edited an item.
  - Adding a calendar entry from the List dialog didn't set the icon properly.

12/13/2003: v0.9.4.8
- Bumped file version to 8.0:
  Modified version number for better backwards compatibility.
  Added new Info section. Currently this only has comments on judges.
- New features / Enhancements:
  - Expanded import/export
  - Cleaned up some descriptions in DefaultConfig.xml. Added Nationals support
    for USDAA (plus some initial changes for USDAA changes)
  - In Points view, added '*' to Title if it has been received.
    Added dog's registration number on venue line.
  - Support the mouse wheel for scrolling in the calendar view.
  - Enhanced list selection (runs, points, calendar, training log)
    - Support multiple selection.
    - Added "select all" (ctrl+a).
  - Enhanced copy support (ctrl+c)
    - Only copy selected items in lists.
    - Moved the copy that was in the calendar list to the calendar view. The
      calendar view now generates a list similar to Karey's. The calendar list
      now copies like the other lists do (whatever is visible in the list).
  - Added the ability to add comments to a judge (menu item "Edit->Judges")
  - Added a 'Valid From' date to an scoring configuration for an event. This
    is currently saved, but not used. It will be used in the future to support
    changes in venues (for instance, say the number of faults allowed for a
    given event changes from 10 to 5)
- Bug fixes
  - Changed copyright notices from "(c)" to <sym> (internal code, not visible)
  - Right-clicking on a Calendar entry sets that as the current date before
    popping up the context menu.
  - Cleaned up page scrolling in calendar view.
  - When creating a calendar entry, the other view didn't update properly.
    Also, when editing an entry in the list, the calendar view didn't update.
  - Fixed a crash when you tried to open a version of an ARB file that was
    saved with a newer version of the program. This only happened when the
    program auto-opened the last open file at startup.
  - Tallying QQs when a 3rd run is present was wrong in the Points view.
  - The QQ checkbox in the run dialog wasn't updating properly.

10/15/2003: v0.9.3.7: Release Candidate 4
- Bumped file version to 7:
  - Allow course faults on runs scored by points. For instance, a handler could
    be faulted for language.
  - Added USDAA Performance Grand Prix to the default configuration.
    Added LAA Points to Other Points. Makes tracking easier.
- New features / Enhancements:
  - Added option to not filter runs by selected trial.
- Bug fixes
  - In Reference Runs, default the score to a perfect score based on venue.
  - If a run does not have titling points, don't show it in the point summary.
  - Fixed a problem displaying Other Points, things could get mixed up.

09/29/2003: v0.9.2.6: Release Candidate 3
- Bug fixes
  - Required points in the Runs dialog were being overwritten with default
    values during initialization.
  - Fixed possible crasher bug in the About dialog.

09/21/2003: v0.9.1.6: Release Candidate 2
- Bumped file version to 6:
  - Added the Training Log.
- New features / Enhancements:
  - Training Log and filtering options for it.
  - Enhanced the 'Filtered' message to be sensitive to the current view.
- Bug fixes
  - When creating a trial entry from the calendar, if you selected more than one
    dog at a time when creating the trial, that new trial was actually linked
    together for both dogs. Changes in one were reflected in the other. The
    "link" was fixed when the file was reloaded.
  - In the pairs partners dialog, the dog's number wasn't being saved.
  - Pasting a trial/run didn't mark the document as needing saving.
  - When adding/pasting a trial/run and the filtering options filtered that new
    item out, a message appeared saying the run wasn't added. Actually it was,
    it just wasn't visible. In addition, the (now) not visible run was not
    sorted properly when the filtered was removed.
  - When updating a configuration, the scoring methods could get messed up.
  - CRCD data could be lost if a run contained no comments or faults.

09/03/2003: v0.9.0.5: Release Candidate 1
- New features / Enhancements:
  - Added a 'deceased' date to the dogs info. (This is a file version change but
    it is backwards compatible, so theres no need to increment the file version)
  - Finished implementing OtherPoints point tallying.
  - Optimized filtering, much faster now.
  - Added filtering by qualifying/non-qualifying runs.
  - Added a 'Filtered' item to the status bar.
  - Added 'New dog/title/trial' items in the r-click menu of the Runs view.
  - Added Print & Print Preview in the Tree.
  - When copying an item in the tree, also copy some text to the clipboard.
  - Copy the runs in the view to the clipboard in tab-separated form (ctrl+c).
    It is copied in the same format that it is printed in.
  - Added copy/paste menu items to the Tree's context menu.
  - When pasting a new trial or run, select the new item.
- Bug fixes
  - A change in 0.4.1.5 to compute the score on NQs was wrong - it computed the
    score on all runs and title points on NQ+Qs. It should only compute score
    on NQ+Q and title points on Qs. This only affected the run entry dialog and
    not the point accumulation view.
  - Cleaned up selection synchronization in the runs and calendar views.
    The trial run list selection now mirrors the tree selection.
  - Fixed bug where "ctrl+tab" didn't change tabs. "Shift+tab" was working.
  - In the calendar/faults/otherpts/partners dialog, set the selection when
    adding/deleting items.
  - Fixed bug (crashes program) when copying the calendar list to the clipboard.

08/16/2003: v0.4.2.5
- 7/23: Published source in sourceforge.net.
- New features / Enhancements:
  - Added printing for runs (not tree though), points and calendar list.
  - Removed automatic sorting of dogs - allow the user to set the ordering.
  - Added actual height and card received info to dog registration information.
  - When trying to cancel from the Run entry dialog, data verification prevented
    the cancel from occurring.
  - Added toolbar items for new dog/title/trial/run/calendar and print preview.
  - Added new options page for fonts, added font for printing, moved calendar
    fonts from calendar options page to this one.
  - In calendar view dialog (dbl-click, etc), show all entries for a date, even
    if the 'hide on entered' option is on.
- Bug fixes
  - Allow screen font selection for calendar printer items. Also the wrong
    font was displayed for the date on the printer.

07/16/2003: v0.4.1.5
- Bumped file version to 5:
  - Added 'Note' and 'Verified' to trials.
  - Changed 'Scoring' to have 'Note' and 'TitlePoints' subitems.
  - Added 'OpeningPts'/'ClosingPts' to event configuration.
  - Changed program version number to reflect file version.
- New features / Enhancements:
  - In Points: Changed the run totalling to be a little cleaner.
  - Reorganized options dialog.
  - Enhanced filtering to filter on divisions/levels.
  - Have the calendar start with the current day as the current selection.
  - Changed the way titling points are configured.
  - Changed calendar current day highlighting so you can tell when the view
    is active. Highlighting is based on system colors.
  - Automatically compute the score in the dog event dialog on both Q and NQ
    runs. Previously, it only computed on Qs.
  - When entering trial data, "remember" certain fields to make data entry
    easier. [Division, Level, Height, Handler, Judge]
  - Add opening points for gamblers/etc into configuration.
  - When errors are found when loading the data, the program attempts to keep
    going. It used to just quit and you would have no data.
  - Complete an "Update rules" mechanism to allow importing updated rules.
    This will merge changes. It will not delete entries in your configuration
    that are not in the new one, with one exception: Event scoring methods
  - Added performance pairs in USDAA (non-titling)
  - Added UKC.
- Bug fixes
  - Fixed date overlap test. If 2 date ranges only partially overlapped, the
    test was wrong. This resulted in calendar entries being visible when they
    shouldn't have been.
  - Copying the calendar data to the clipboard didn't insert a newline after
    the header.
  - From v0.3.0.1: If the viewing filter was enabled and you changed the
    venue of an existing trial, the trial continued to be visible even though
    the filter should have suppressed it.
  - The program didn't always prompt to save on close when something changed.
  - When creating new faults, they didn't show up in the list until after the
    run was saved.
  - The configuration 'Drop Fractions' setting wasn't properly applied.
  - If a level on a run is entered wrong (via hand-editing), that entry
    loaded with no warnings.

06/15/2003: v0.3.0.2
- Bumped file version to 4:
  - Added item to configuration scoring methods to drop fractional time faults.
  - Added a description to venues and events in the configuration.
- New features
  - Added CPE to default configuration.
  - Enable copy/paste of trials and runs.
  - Added filtering on multiple venues.
  - Tally points by level, not sublevel. Then things like NADAC
    Novice A/B add up in one place.
  - Points View: Tally Clean/Unclean Qs
- Bug fixes
  - Wasn't remembering the selected view between program invokations.
  - NewLine wasn't handled properly in Event Configuration dialog notes.
  - Editing an existing configuration Title failed with the message
    that it already exists. (divisions/levels/faults/otherpts too)

06/02/2003: v0.3.0.1: No longer calling releases alpha/beta/etc.
- Bumped file version to 3:
  - Add notes to configuration events specifically for USDAA DAM jumpers and
    snooker - the fact the "Q" there applies towards master legs and DAM relay
    Q implies the team qualified overall.
  - Moved Fault Types in configuration from Venue to global.
  - Moved Other Points in the same manner.
  - Added 'Received' field to Title.
- New features:
  - Create a trial entry from a calendar entry.
  - Add a delay factor to auto-delete of old calendar entries. (default: 5 days)
  - Allow runs (in tree) and faults (in run) to be reordered. Note, sometimes
    it will appear reordering fails. This will be due to sorting. For
    instance, runs and calendar entries are sorted by date, then reordering.
  - Added initial configuration updating. It will add any new entries, but
    will not yet update existing entries.
    [See a note in Todo.txt about updating venue configurations.]
- Minor enhancements:
  - Updated default USDAA config rules.
  - Tally the list of fault types like I do with judges. (You don't need to
    modify the configuration to have a new fault type show up in the selection
    list)
  - In points view, show the number of partners for Qs, not just total number
    of partners. When tallying the number of pairs partners, only 2-dog relays
    are tallied. This prevents some odd things when counting USDAA DAM
    tournament relays.
  - After creating a new dog/trial/run (via rclick menu), make that the selected
    item. (The wrong item was selected if you rclicked on an entry other than
    the current selection)
  - When entering a new run, the default date should be last date in the trial.
  - Modified calendar entry dialog to show trial opening/closing dates.
  - When an entry in the calendar list is selected, make calendar date in the
    right window pane selected too.
  - Added an 'edit' button to edit an existing registration num
  - Added an 'edit' button to edit an existing club
  - After inserting a trial/run in the tree, it was not properly sorted.
  - Add column sorting to reference runs.
  - Add option to reverse-sort trials and runs (newest first). This will also
    reverse the user re-ordering.
- Bug fixes:
  - Changing the Selected dog didn't update the points view.
  - Points view: QQ tallied wrong (it was double counting)
  - When venues are not filtered, ASCA pts were incorrectly totaled.
  - When modifying a configuration event, when a new div/level pair was
    created, the 'not defined' items weren't updated.
  - When an event is not qualifying (as defined in the configuration), the
    "q" list was still available when entering a run - not really an issue
    since it didn't get tallied.

04/03/2003: v0.2.0.3: Release Alpha5
Known issues: See the 'todo.txt' file.

02/23/2003: v0.2.0.2: Release Alpha4
- Modified default rules to add USDAA's Tournament classes.
  - If you have an existing file, the only way to get the new default rules
    is to hand edit. A future enhancement is to add an automated way of doing
    this. Currently: Create a new empty file and save it. Copy everything
    between "<Configuration>" and "</Configuration>" are replace the lines
    in your current file. Be careful!
- Minor bug fixes:
  - The date on a new run was occasionally 12/31/1969.
  - Made comboboxes for division and level wider in the RunEntry dialog.
  - Made the combobox for a new fault longer (so more are visible)
  - Made '0' the default from score in the reference run dialog.
  - In the 'Other Points' dialog, made the desc an edit field so it can scroll.
  - When modifying the configuration, the scoring methods were not updated.

- Run entry dialog
  - Titling points (mach/doubleQ) now appear correctly.
  - Enable/disable buttons properly.
  - Double-click on reference run now edits that entry.
- General:
  - Fixed all multi-line edit controls to auto-wrap correctly.

01/22/2003: v0.1.0.1: Release Alpha2
- 2nd alpha [vc6 only]
- Major data entry dialogs are complete.
- Main views on data are not. Program options still need implementing. Lots
  of outstanding tidbits.

- Second release [vc6&7] (still considering this the 1st alpha)
- Mainly just VC6 support due to some VC7 compatibility issues on older OSs.
