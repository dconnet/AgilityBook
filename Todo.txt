- Add 'YPS' into Reference Run list

- Make the trial properties dialog easier to add a club.

- Add persistence to CalSite location/venue selection data.

- Add persistence to selected CalSites.

- Be able to select yards or meters (this is really just a visual thing, since
  the program won't do anything differently)

- Add a way to set the icon for a venue.
  Currently, it's handcoded in the configuration.

- Remember printer page orientation. (See KB166130: "How To Overriding
  Initial Setting on Print Setup Dialog" (their bad-english, not mine!))

- Add drag-drop support in the runs view to move/copy runs.

- Create named import/export settings.

- Add display name to configuration items.

- Make the Run dialog combo boxes check the filter to 'hide' levels/etc.

- Make TopTen (OtherPoint) visible in the Runs view.

- Fix printing so it wraps multi-line text.
  Possibly have printed columns managed separately from viewed columns.

- Import/Export data formats (formats, etc)
  - Calendar export: Generate a listing like Karey's
    <http://www.bayteam.org/docs/KareysCalendar.html>
  - Import Runs: Need some intelligence to group several days of runs into a
    single trial.
  - Export Runs: Figure out a way to export the reference runs.
    Also imbedded CRCD and linked files?
  - Import: Add intelligence to deal with multi-line data. Not sure this really
    makes sense: Excel can't handle it either...

- Run entry dialog integrity checks (define!)
  - If faults entered is greated then faults allowed, and 'Q' is set, warn
    about possible problem
  - If 'Q' not set and total faults says it should be a Q, warn.
  - ...

- Add logic to the reorder dialog to know if an item can be reordered around
  an adjacent entry. (For instance, when reordering runs, reordering really
  only applies to runs on a given date. If you attempt to reorder more, the
  sorting that occurs after the reordering will undo what you did.)

=== Considered, but probably will never do. ===

- Add a column in runs to allow cumulative title points. Also add this to
  the score tab in the run properties.
  - Probably not - due to the current implementation, this could be rather
    expensive.

- Possible expense tracking?
  - Most users said NO!

- Refine Points (rename to Reports?)
  - track faults, generate avgs in ranges (.5 refusals in last 6 months
    compared to .8 in previous 6)
  - Qs related to judges
  - fastest yps/avg (base on related events)
  - graph of similar runs showing yps, include sct.
  --- Note the previous stuff will probably _not_ be implemented. Now that
      we have a good export mechanism, spreadsheet programs are much better
      at data analysis than I am!
