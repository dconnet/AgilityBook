- Add auto-lifetime point accumulation. Currently known ones are NADAC (all
  points at all levels) and USDAA (points from Masters std and non-std events,
  plus GP). This is currently handled manually via OtherPoints. It would be
  nice to include auto-top10 accumulation also. (USDAA lifetime Top10
  accululates from 1/1/99)

- Import/Export data formats (formats, etc)
  - Calendar export: Generate a listing like Karey's
    <http://www.bayteam.org/docs/KareysCalendar.html>
  - Import: when implemented, make sure there are comments in the dialogs
    about the importance of matching div/level/etc names to the config names.
    In addition, need some intelligence to group several days of runs into a
    single trial.

- Rework Configuration dialog so it is easier to use.
  - Allow items (divisions/levels/etc) in config dialog to be reordered.
    (currently you have to _carefully_ hand edit the file)

- Run entry dialog integrity checks (define!)
  - If faults entered is greated then faults allowed, and 'Q' is set, warn
    about possible problem
  - If 'Q' not set and total faults says it should be a Q, warn.
  - ...

- Add logic to the reorder dialog to know if an item can be reordered around
  an adjacent entry. (For instance, when reordering runs, reordering really
  only applies to runs on a given date. If you attempt to reorder more, the
  sorting that occurs after the reordering will undo what you did.)

- Refine Points (rename to Reports?)
  - track faults, generate avgs in ranges (.5 refusals in last 6 months
    compared to .8 in previous 6)
  - Qs related to judges
  - fastest yps/avg (base on related events)
  - graph of similar runs showing yps, include sct.
  --- Note the previous stuff will probably _not_ be implemented. Now that
      we have a good export mechanism, spreadsheet programs are much better
      at data analysis than I am!
