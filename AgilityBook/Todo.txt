- Create 'named' title points. For instance, a named Lifetime point could
  be ASCA's 'Finals Points'.

- Add warning in run dialog when Q is UNK that the following will not
  be saved:
  - Place/InClass/DogsQ
  - Other Points

- Add support for lifetime points in NADAC Extreme. This needs to use the
  Bonus Points to determine lifetime.
  - 50 - 74.99 == 5
  - 75 - 99.99 == 10
  - >=100 == 15

- Create a fully standalone version (for USB). Config file too.
  (supported by existence of AgilityBook.info, no way to auto-create yet)

- Add a way to suppress sub-levels. Both NADAC and USDAA have simplified
  their Novice structure. ARB does not have a way of expressing this (yet).

-Import/Export info:
  Calendar:
    fuzzy match: startdate/enddate/venue/club
    CAgilityBookDoc::ImportARBCalEntry
  Training:
    exact match
    (could do fuzzy: date/name/subname)
    CAgilityBookDoc::ImportARBLogEntry
  Trials:
    CAgilityBookDoc::ImportARBRunData
      Dogs: match by callname
        if dog exists, only update existing points registration numbers,
        titles and trials.  otherwise, entire dog data merged
      Trials: if newTrial != oldTrial, add newtrial (no merging happens)
  CWizardImport::DoWizardFinish
    A lot more logic to find scoringstyle, then run

- USDAA top-10 calculations:
  - Number of places
    - 1-3 dogs: 1
    - 4-5 dogs: 2
    - 6-10 dogs: 3
    - >10: ((NumDogs - 1) / 10) + 3 [integer truncation]
  - Points: (NumDogs - Place) * 2 + 1

- Make Mac dmg nicer for install (DnD app into Application folder)

- Make the trial properties dialog easier to add a club.

- Add persistence to CalSite location/venue selection data.

- Add persistence to selected CalSites.

- Be able to select yards or meters (this is really just a visual thing, since
  the program won't do anything differently)

- Add a way to set the icon for a venue.
  Currently, it's handcoded in the configuration.

- Add drag-drop support in the runs view to move/copy runs.

- Add display name to configuration items.

- Make the Run dialog combo boxes check the filter to 'hide' levels/etc.

- Make TopTen (OtherPoint) visible in the Runs view.

- Fix printing so it wraps multi-line text.
  Possibly have printed columns managed separately from viewed columns.

- Import/Export data formats (formats, etc)
  - Calendar export: Generate a listing like Karey's
    <http://www.bayteam.org/docs/KareysCalendar.html>
  - Export Runs: Figure out a way to export the reference runs.
    Also imbedded CRCD and linked files?

- Run entry dialog integrity checks (define!)
  - If faults entered is greated then faults allowed, and 'Q' is set, warn
    about possible problem
  - If 'Q' not set and total faults says it should be a Q, warn.
  - ...

- Add logic to the reorder dialog to know if an item can be reordered around
  an adjacent entry. (For instance, when reordering runs, reordering really
  only applies to runs on a given date. If you attempt to reorder more, the
  sorting that occurs after the reordering will undo what you did.)

=== Considered, but probably will never do. ===

- Add a column in runs to allow cumulative title points. Also add this to
  the score tab in the run properties.
  - Probably not - due to the current implementation, this could be rather
    expensive.

- Possible expense tracking?
  - Most users said NO!

- Refine Points (rename to Reports?)
  - track faults, generate avgs in ranges (.5 refusals in last 6 months
    compared to .8 in previous 6)
  - Qs related to judges
  - fastest yps/avg (base on related events)
  - graph of similar runs showing yps, include sct.
  --- Note the previous stuff will probably _not_ be implemented. Now that
      we have a good export mechanism, spreadsheet programs are much better
      at data analysis than I am!
