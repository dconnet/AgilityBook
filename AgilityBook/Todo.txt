- Development issue:
  There is a problem somewhere in the Configuration dialogs. When running under
  the debugger (in either release or debug), the following messages will be
  seen (the heap block number and exception address will vary):
    HEAP[AgilityBook.exe]: HEAP: Free Heap block 170830 modified at 170acc after it was freed
    Unhandled exception at 0x77f75a58 in AgilityBook.exe: User breakpoint.
  If looks like MFC is accessing a window that no longer exists. When I comment
  out certain sections of code, it goes away - actually, I think it just moves.
  I have ABSOLUTELY no clue what the hell is going on. If it continues, I may
  just scrap the whole configuration dialog setup I've got and try something
  totally different. I tried to use SmartHeap - to no avail. This is seen in
  both VC6 and VC7. I've commented out all of my 'delete's, but it still
  happens (therefore, it can't be my stuff!). Tracing into the MFC internals,
  it occurs when DestroyWindow is called on CDlgConfigVenue. One time, I
  actually got the program totally stuck when trying to release critical
  sections. And I don't use critical sections!

- Add auto-lifetime point accumulation. Currently known ones are NADAC (all
  points at all levels) and USDAA (points from Masters std and non-std events,
  plus GP). This is currently handled manually via OtherPoints. It would be
  nice to include auto-top10 accumulation also. (USDAA lifetime Top10
  accululates from 1/1/99)

- Import/Export data formats (formats, etc)
  - Calendar export: Generate a listing like Karey's
    <http://www.bayteam.org/docs/KareysCalendar.html>
  - Import: Need some intelligence to group several days of runs into a
    single trial.

- Run entry dialog integrity checks (define!)
  - If faults entered is greated then faults allowed, and 'Q' is set, warn
    about possible problem
  - If 'Q' not set and total faults says it should be a Q, warn.
  - ...

- Add logic to the reorder dialog to know if an item can be reordered around
  an adjacent entry. (For instance, when reordering runs, reordering really
  only applies to runs on a given date. If you attempt to reorder more, the
  sorting that occurs after the reordering will undo what you did.)

- Refine Points (rename to Reports?)
  - track faults, generate avgs in ranges (.5 refusals in last 6 months
    compared to .8 in previous 6)
  - Qs related to judges
  - fastest yps/avg (base on related events)
  - graph of similar runs showing yps, include sct.
  --- Note the previous stuff will probably _not_ be implemented. Now that
      we have a good export mechanism, spreadsheet programs are much better
      at data analysis than I am!
