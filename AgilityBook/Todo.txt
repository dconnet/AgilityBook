- Allow users to specify their own splash screen.
  - Just need to add UI to specify name - note, only .bmp is supported

- After adding a title, display the dog properties on title page. Too many
  people can't find it afterwards.

- Fix printing so it wraps multi-line text.

- Create a printable form for data input (that can be put in a notebook)

- Import/Export data formats (formats, etc)
  - Calendar export: Generate a listing like Karey's
    <http://www.bayteam.org/docs/KareysCalendar.html>
  - Import: Need some intelligence to group several days of runs into a
    single trial.
  - Import: Add intelligence to deal with quotes/multi-line data.
  - Export: Add quote character
  - Export: Figure out a way to export the reference runs
            How about imbedded CRCD and linked files?

- Run entry dialog integrity checks (define!)
  - If faults entered is greated then faults allowed, and 'Q' is set, warn
    about possible problem
  - If 'Q' not set and total faults says it should be a Q, warn.
  - ...

- Add logic to the reorder dialog to know if an item can be reordered around
  an adjacent entry. (For instance, when reordering runs, reordering really
  only applies to runs on a given date. If you attempt to reorder more, the
  sorting that occurs after the reordering will undo what you did.)

- Refine Points (rename to Reports?)
  - track faults, generate avgs in ranges (.5 refusals in last 6 months
    compared to .8 in previous 6)
  - Qs related to judges
  - fastest yps/avg (base on related events)
  - graph of similar runs showing yps, include sct.
  --- Note the previous stuff will probably _not_ be implemented. Now that
      we have a good export mechanism, spreadsheet programs are much better
      at data analysis than I am!
