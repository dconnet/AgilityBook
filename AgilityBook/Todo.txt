- Development issue:
  There is a problem somewhere in the Configuration dialogs. When running under
  the debugger (in either release or debug), the following messages will be
  seen (the heap block number and exception address will vary):
    HEAP[AgilityBook.exe]: HEAP: Free Heap block 170830 modified at 170acc after it was freed
    Unhandled exception at 0x77f75a58 in AgilityBook.exe: User breakpoint.
  [To reproduce: Open Config dlg, dbl-click on 'USDAA'. In events, scroll up
  to 'Snooker' and dbl-click. 'OK'. Twitch mouse over events tree. Boom. There
  may be other ways, but this is the most consistent. This can be done in a new
  file. The call stack looks very strange...]
  If looks like MFC is accessing a window that no longer exists. When I comment
  out certain sections of code, it goes away - actually, I think it just moves.
  I have ABSOLUTELY no clue what the hell is going on. If it continues, I may
  just scrap the whole configuration dialog setup I've got and try something
  totally different. I tried to use SmartHeap - to no avail. This is seen in
  both VC6 and VC7. I've commented out all of my 'delete's, but it still
  happens. Tracing into the MFC internals, it occurs when DestroyWindow is
  called on CDlgConfigVenue. One time, I actually got the program totally
  stuck when trying to release critical sections. And I don't use critical
  sections! It does somehow seem related to the ARBConfigScoring items in the
  Event tree.
  Update 4/20: It looks like the combination of having tooltips and having
  textcallbacks on the scoring items is triggering things. Turning off tooltips
  "fixes" it, changing the callback (CDlgConfigureDataScoring) to return a fixed
  string "fixes" it (so does getting rid of the text callback). Not inserting
  the scoring items "fixes" it. [Or does it just move it? Still don't know...]
  Commenting out the scoring assignment in DlgConfigEvent doesn't change
  anything.

- Import/Export data formats (formats, etc)
  - Calendar export: Generate a listing like Karey's
    <http://www.bayteam.org/docs/KareysCalendar.html>
  - Import: Need some intelligence to group several days of runs into a
    single trial.

- Run entry dialog integrity checks (define!)
  - If faults entered is greated then faults allowed, and 'Q' is set, warn
    about possible problem
  - If 'Q' not set and total faults says it should be a Q, warn.
  - ...

- Add logic to the reorder dialog to know if an item can be reordered around
  an adjacent entry. (For instance, when reordering runs, reordering really
  only applies to runs on a given date. If you attempt to reorder more, the
  sorting that occurs after the reordering will undo what you did.)

- Refine Points (rename to Reports?)
  - track faults, generate avgs in ranges (.5 refusals in last 6 months
    compared to .8 in previous 6)
  - Qs related to judges
  - fastest yps/avg (base on related events)
  - graph of similar runs showing yps, include sct.
  --- Note the previous stuff will probably _not_ be implemented. Now that
      we have a good export mechanism, spreadsheet programs are much better
      at data analysis than I am!
