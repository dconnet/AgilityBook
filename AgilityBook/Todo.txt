- Add logic to the reorder dialog to know if an item can be reordered around
  an adjacent entry. (For instance, when reordering runs, reordering really
  only applies to runs on a given date. If you attempt to reorder more, the
  sorting that occurs after the reordering will undo what you did.)

- Import/Export data formats (formats, etc)
  - Calendar export: Generate a listing like Karey's
    <http://www.bayteam.org/docs/KareysCalendar.html>

- Rework Configuration dialog so it is easier to use.

- Allow items (divisions/levels/etc) in config dialog to be reordered.
  (currently you have to _carefully_ hand edit the file)

- Allow the user to specify what data to show for a trial in the tree.
  Currently "startDate-endDate Venue: Location"

- Runs: Allow the user to specify what columns to show.
  Additional column info? (title pts, times, etc)

- CalList: Allow the user to specify what columns to show.

- Runs: Allow the user to specify what columns to print.

- CalList: Allow the user to specify what columns to print.

- Refine Points (rename to Reports?)
  - track faults, generate avgs in ranges (.5 refusals in last 6 months
    compared to .8 in previous 6)
  - Qs related to judges
  - fastest yps/avg (base on related events)

- Run entry dialog integrity checks (define!)
  - If faults entered is greated then faults allowed, and 'Q' is set, warn
    about possible problem
  - If 'Q' not set and total faults says it should be a Q, warn.
  - ...
