- Known Issues/Bugs [1-5 Hi-Low priority]
  - [3] OtherPoints point tallying is not implemented as stated. Currently,
    it ignores the configured option and tallies by "All Events"
  - [5] <v0.3.0.1>
    Add logic to the reorder dialog to know if an item can be reordered around
    an adjacent entry. (For instance, when reordering runs, reordering really
    only applies to runs on a given date. If you attempt to reorder more, the
    sorting that occurs after the reordering will undo what you did.)

- Feature requests:
  - [3] <v0.2.0.3>
    Rework Configuration dialog so it is easier to use.
  - [4] <v0.3.0.1>
    Allow items in config dialog to be reordered.
    (currently you have to _carefully_ hand edit the file)
  - [5] <v0.2.0.1>
