There are two files here:

    AgilityBook_<version>.zip
        This is what you want! Download load this file onto your computer
        and unzip the files. Once unzipped, run the .msi program. Once
        installed, you can delete the msi/cab files.
        - Note, if the installation has problems, you may need to download
        and install WindowsInstaller 3.1. This is available from Microsoft:

    AgilityBook_<version>src.zip
        Source code to create the program. Usually, only developers are
        interested in this.
