To install this:

First time:
===========
Create a directory on your system, for instance "C:\AgilityBook" and download
the files 'xerces-c_2_7.zip' and 'AgilityBook_N_N_N_NALT.zip' (where N will be the
current version).

Unzip those files into the directory you created.

Attempt to run. If the system complains about a DLL, then download and install
vcredist_x86.exe (this contains VC8 runtime files). The program should run
properly now.


Updating to a new version:
==========================
Download the new 'AgilityBook_N_N_N_NALT.zip' file and unzip to your existing
directory.
