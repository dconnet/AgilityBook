Building on Ubuntu Linux:

1. svn co https://agilitybook.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/agilitybook/trunk/AgilityBook
2. cd AgilityBook
3. autoconf
4. mkdir build
5. cd build
6. ../configure
At this point the Makefile have been generated in all src subdirs and any changes to any of the Makefile.in files or the configure.in file will cause Makefiles to be be automatically regenerated.

So to build the application and related libs:
1. cd build
2. make


       
Compile errors:

1. install boost dev lib:
sudo apt-get install libboost-dev

1. install wxgtk:s
  Version 2.8.9 or later wxWidget package is required
  http://wiki.wxpython.org/InstallingOnUbuntuOrDebian
  sudo apt-get install python-wxgtk2.8 python-wxtools wx2.8-i18n


2. make sure /usr/bin is on your path and wx-config can be found


UNIT TESTS
1. extract UnitTests.zip to: src/UnitTests++
2. cd src/UnitTests++
3. make
