<h1>Points</h1>
<p>The Points tab is made up of one main window.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/TabPoints.gif"></p>
<p>If you right-click on an item (or press the "Window Menu" key on the keyboard),
a <a href="MenuPoints.html">context menu</a> will appear 
allowing you to perform a number of actions.</p>
<p>This window only presents information to you.
You can adjust what is visible by modifying the
filter in the <a href="DlgOptionsTrial.html">viewing preferences</a>.</p>
<p>One thing to note about the view preferences: Only the venue and date
portions of the filter apply to this view. The Qualifying status of runs is
ignored. This is done in order to compute the qualifying status. Since this
view is designed to show how many points you have earned, it doesn't make
much sense to use the qualifying status of the filter!</p>
<p>There is some additional information that can be accessed in this view.
By using the mouse and double clicking on an entry (or using the keyboard and
pressing either space or enter), you can access the data that makes up a line.
Double clicking on the dogs name or a venue line will bring up the
<a href="PropDog.html">dogs property dialog</a>. Double clicking on a title
will bring up the <a href="DlgTitle.html">title properties</a>.
Double clicking on an event, Multiple-Q, or Other Points line will bring up
a dialog similar to this:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgPointsDetails.gif"></p>
<p>If you double click on a LifeTime Points line, a dialog listing how many
points at each level will be presented, using the prior dialog with
Division, Level and Points columns.</p>
<p>If you press the <b>Copy</b> button, it will copy all the data in this
dialog to the clipboard in a tab delineated style suitable for pasting into
a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Note: Not all lines in the Points view have details.
If you attempt to open one that does not, it will beep at you.</p>
