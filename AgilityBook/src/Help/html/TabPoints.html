<h1>Points</h1>
<p>The Points tab is made up of one main window.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/TabPoints.gif" width="743" height="400"></p>
<p>This window only presents information to you. There is no context menu or 
dialogs like in the other tabs. You can adjust what is visible by modifying the 
filter in the <a href="DlgOptionsTrial.html">viewing preferences</a>. </p>
<p>One thing to note about the view preferences: Only the venue and date 
portions of the filter apply to this view. The Qualifying status of runs is 
ignored. This is done in order to compute the qualifying status. Since this view 
is designed to show how many points you have earned, it doesn't make much sense 
to use the qualifying status of the filter!</p>
