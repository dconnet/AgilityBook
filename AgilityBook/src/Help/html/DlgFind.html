<h1>Find Dialog</h1>
<p>The Find Dialog allows you to locate various items in the current view. In 
tabs that have multiple windows, it only applies to the current one.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgFind.gif" width="329" height="175"></p>
<p>Most of the fields should be fairly obvious as to their use. The <b>Field to 
search</b> item is used to limit the search to only fields that are visible, or 
whether to search all fields.</p>
