<h1>Editing a dog</h1>
<p>The first time you edit a dog, you are presented with a dialog that has the 
following four pages:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#Properties">Properties</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Titles">Titles</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Registration">Registration Numbers</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Existing">Existing Points</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Properties">Properties</a></h2>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgNewDogProp.gif" width="551" height="387"></p>
<p>The only field that you absolutely must fill out is the Call Name. All other 
fields are optional. Though you probably will want to set the date of birth to 
the correct date!</p>
<p>The Notes field is for an miscellaneous data you may want to record, for 
instance, an embedded chip id or city license number.</p>
<h2><a name="Titles">Titles</a></h2>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgNewDogTitles.gif" width="551" height="387"></p>
<p>This page is for recording an titles that you earn. After entering a title 
via a menu item or the toolbar
<img border="0" src="images/ToolbarNewTitle.gif" width="18" height="17">, you will be 
taken to this page.</p>
<p>The &quot;View Hidden&quot; option (also available on the main &quot;View-&gt;Show Hidden 
Titles&quot; menu), allows you to hide titles you no longer want to see. There are 
two occasions you may want to hide a title:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The title has been superceded by a later title. For instance, earning your 
  MX in AKC implies that you have earned your AX.</li>
  <li>The title is one you will never earn. For instance, if you started 
  competing in USDAA prior to 2004 and are currently in Masters, you will never 
  earn the new game titles.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Registration">Registration Numbers</a></h2>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgNewDogRegNum.gif" width="551" height="387"></p>
<h2><a name="Existing">Existing Points</a></h2>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgNewDogExistingPts.gif" width="551" height="387"></p>
