<h1>Calendar</h1>
<p>The Calendar tab is made up of two main windows. The view on the left is 
known as the Calendar List, the one on the right is the Calendar.
(The right-side Calendar view will resize itself to fit the view.)</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/TabCalendar.gif"></p>
<p>When you select an entry in the list, the day of the trial will be 
highlighted in the right side. The view that currently has focus will have the 
selected item drawn more visibly (in the above picture, the left view has 
focus).</p>
<p>If you right-click on an item (or press the &quot;Window Menu&quot; key on the 
keyboard), a <a href="MenuCalendar.html">context menu </a>will appear allowing 
you to perform a number of actions.</p>
<p>Also, double-clicking on an item (in either window), will bring up a
<a href="PropCal.html">dialog</a> (the <b>Properties</b> item in the context 
menu will do the same thing).</p>
