<h1>View Filters</h1>
<p>Filters allows you to set a filter that will hide entries in
the main views.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgOptionsFilter.gif"></p>
<p>The <i>Named Filters</i> section allows you to create multiple filters
and easily change between them. When you press <b>Save</b>, the filtering
options that are currently set will be saved into the filter that is currently
named. If you make additional changes and then close the dialog, those changes
will not be saved into the named filter, though the changes will affect how
filtering is currently done. Use <b>Delete</b> to remove the selected filter.</p>
<p>Changing the <i>Dates</i> radio button will also enable the fields below it.
If neither checkbox is checked when you close the dialog, the Dates setting will
revert back to viewing all dates. Filtering dates affects all the views.</p>
<p>The <i>Calendar Entries</i> allow you to hide entries in the Calendar
view. <b>View Not Entered</b> will show all entries that are marked as not
entered. <b>View Planning</b> will show all entries marked as planning. And <b>
View Entered</b> will show all entries you have entered. These options apply to
both the views in the Calendar view. Note, if all checkboxes are unchecked,
no entries will appear in either calendar view.</p>
<p>The <i>Training Log Names</i> option allows you to hide entries in the
Training Log based on their names.
This applies only to the Training Log view.</p>
<p>The <i>Qs</i> options allow you to view only runs that meet the desired
selection. By combining this option and the Venues/Levels, it can be a very
easy way of determining how you have done during a given time period. For
instance, to determine how many point you have earned in a given time period,
you could set the Date filter to the preceding year, the Venue/Levels to
AKC/Excellent B and the Qs to Only Qualifying. The Points view will then show
how many points you have earned in that time.</p>
<p>When filtering by Qs, it is important to note that there is one place that
will ignore this particular filter:
the <a href="TabPoints.html">Points View</a>.
This is simply so it can display a Qualifying percentage that makes sense.
In addition, the Points View will ignore all filtering when tallying lifetime
points.</p>
<p>The <i>Venues/Levels</i> option allows you to hide runs.
When you select the &quot;View only&quot; radio button, the tree below it is
enabled. When you check or uncheck any checkbox, it will also check/uncheck
all checkboxes below it.
This affects all views except for the Training Log.</p>
<p>All options are saved into the local Windows Registry.</p>
