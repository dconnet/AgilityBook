<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgAbout.gif" width="441" height="232"></p>
<p>When discussing the program with others, it is often helpful to know which 
version you are discussing. This can be easily obtained in the first line.</p>
<p>The second paragraph provides information about the distribution rights. As 
noted, this program is free. However, we simply request that you make a donation 
to a local shelter or rescue group. This donation may in the form of 
volunteering also. We rely on your honesty for this.</p>
<p>In addition, there are a couple of hotlinks to provide easy access to some 
convenient email addresses and web sites.</p>
<p>The <b>Check for Updates...</b> button provides an easy way to see if there 
is a new version of the program available. See the
<a href="FileManagement.html#Updates">Checking for updates</a>
for more information.</p>
