<h1>Training Log Properties</h1>
<p>The Training Log properties are very simple and should be self-explanatory.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgTrainingLog.gif" width="456" height="352"></p>
<p>The Name and SubName fields list all previously created names. You can also 
type anything you want. These are used to <a href="DlgOptionsLog.html">filter</a> 
the view.</p>
<p>You can press the Enter key to insert blank lines in the notes. When 
displayed in the main view, all information is flattened into a single line.</p>
