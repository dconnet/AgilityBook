<h1>Points View Sort Order Dialog</h1>
<p>The Points View Sort Order dialog allows you determine how events should
be ordered in the Points view.</p>

<p>The three comboboxes allow you to specify how the events in the Points
view should ordered.
Version 1.7.3.12 and earlier had a fixed order of Division/Level/Event.
The image above shows the new default settings.
