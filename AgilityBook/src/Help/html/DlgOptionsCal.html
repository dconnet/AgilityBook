<h1>Calendar Options</h1>
<p>The Calendar options apply to all Calendar entries.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgOptionsCal.gif" width="473" height="357"></p>
<p>In the Calendar View, you can change which day of the week should appear at 
the start.</p>
<p>Once a date has passed, the old entry can either be hidden or deleted. In 
either case, you can configure the program to define how much time should pass 
before an entry is considered past. Setting this value too low can make it 
difficult if you wish to create a trial directly from the calendar entry.</p>
<p>The &quot;Hide entries on dates where you've entered a trial&quot; is convenient for 
hiding trials that you will not be entering. It helps keep the calendar from 
being too cluttered.</p>
<p>The next option allows you to change the size of the calendar entry. The 
default size is 100 by 70. For laptops with smaller screens (for instance 
1024x768), you may want to change these values like you see above.</p>
<p>The items in <b>Filter Entries</b> control which calendar entries will
be visible in both parts of the calendar. If all items are turned off, then
nothing will be visibile in the calendar.</p>
<p>There are also several options for changing how the Calendar List and 
Calendar Views are displayed. The options grouped together apply only to the 
part of the calendar mentioned.</p>
<ul>
	<li>When &quot;Warn when the Opening date is near&quot; is enabled,
	entries that you are planning on entering will be displayed in the
	specified color when the current date is within the given range.</li>
	<li>When &quot;Warn when the Closing date is near&quot; is enabled,
	entries that you are planning on entering will be displayed in the
	specified color when the current date is within the given range.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>When &quot;Entries with Opening dates&quot; is enabled, the opening
	date (if set) for an entry that is currently visibile will be displayed
	in the specified color.</li>
	<li>When &quot;Entries with Closing dates&quot; is enabled, the closing
	date (if set) for an entry that is currently visibile will be displayed
	in the specified color.</li>
</ul>
<p>All View Options are saved into the local Windows Registry.</p>
