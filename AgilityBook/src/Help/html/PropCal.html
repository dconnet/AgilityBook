<h1>Calendar Properties</h1>
<p>There are two dialogs associated with a calendar entry. This first dialog is 
displayed when you select a menu item from the <a href="MenuCalendar.html">
context menu </a>in the Calendar View. Since there may be multiple entries on a 
given day, this dialog is used to select which entry you want to work with.</p>

<p>When you create an entry (or edit an existing one), the following dialog is 
displayed.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgCalendar.gif" width="432" height="409"></p>
<p>If the trial is still tentative (for instance, you know a club always holds 
their trial on the Labor Day weekend, but it hasn't been announced yet), use the 
checkbox to signify this. You can also indicate whether you are planning on 
entering the trial. The following icons are used in the Calendar List to show 
the status of an entry.</p>
<p>There is no icon for a trial that is not tentative and that you are not 
entering.<br>
<img border="0" src="images/CalEntered.gif" width="13" height="11"> You have 
entered this trial.<br>
<img border="0" src="images/CalMaybe.gif" width="13" height="13"> You are 
planning on entering this trial.<br>
<img border="0" src="images/CalTentative.gif" width="13" height="13"> The 
information for this trial is still tentative.<br>
<img border="0" src="images/CalTentativeEntered.gif" width="13" height="13"> 
This trial is still tentative, but you have entered it. (A little odd, and not 
likely to occur!)<br>
<img border="0" src="images/CalTentativeMaybe.gif" width="13" height="13"> This 
trial is still tentative, and you are planning on entering it.</p>
<p>The location field contains a list of locations from all the trials you have 
created and all of the calendar entries. You may also type anything you want in 
this field.</p>
<p>The club and venue fields work the same way. However, if you want to create a 
trial entry directly from a calendar entry, you should only select a venue that 
is currently configured. You can enter &quot;NADAC/ASCA&quot; for a co-sanctioned trial, 
however, since that is not a valid venue (taken as a single string), you cannot 
create the trial directly. The recommended way to do this is to list only one 
venue and put the co-sanctioning information in the notes. Then when you create 
the trial, you can add the second venue.</p>
<p>If the opening and closing dates for the trial are known, you can uncheck the 
&quot;Unknown&quot; checkbox and set the date. These fields are for your information only.</p>
<p>The final field, notes, is simply so you can make any comments you want.</p>
