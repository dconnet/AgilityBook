<h1>Existing Points Dialog</h1>
<p>The Existing Points dialog allows you to create or edit a points that you
have already earned in a specific venue. This allows you to create a dog in
Agility Record Book that has been competing for a long time and not have to
enter every run they have done. (Though some people have commented that doing
so was a fun jaunt down memory lane...)
</p>

<p>The <b>Points Earned by</b> field is the date the points you are entered 
where earned by, not necessarily on. <b>Points</b> is the under of points you 
earned.</p>
<p>The <b>Type</b> of points will affect which fields are active:</p>
