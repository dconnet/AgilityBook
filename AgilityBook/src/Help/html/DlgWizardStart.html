<h1>Import / Export Wizard</h1>
<p>The Import Export Wizard allows you to import or export data directly with
Microsoft Excel (providing Excel can be found on your system). In addition,
it can import or export data in a text form that is usable by most spreadsheet
programs. Finally, it can import and export data in the Agility Record Book
format for exchange with other Agility Record Book users.
The options available between Excel (the text spreadsheet form uses the same
options as Excel) and Agility Record Book formats are
slightly different, as you can see from the dialogs.</p>
<p>Special note for exporting to Microsoft Outlook: Even though Outlook
supports importing Excel, tab-delimited and comma-delimited files, the only
format I have been able to successfully import (in Outlook 2003) is
comma-delimited. All three files look correct, Outlook simply fails to import
Excel and tab-delimited files.</p>

<p>When you select in entry in the list, a description will be displayed on the 
right describing what will happen. When exporting for a spreadsheet, you need to
<a href="DlgWizardExport.html">specify the format</a>. Also, when you import 
from a spreadsheet, you also need to <a href="DlgWizardImport.html">specify the 
format</a>. Note, when working with Excel, the delimiter section shown in the
previous links will be hidden since it is not necessary.</p>

<p>When importing and exporting in the Agility Record Book format, the only 
additional information you need to supply is the name of the file.</p>
