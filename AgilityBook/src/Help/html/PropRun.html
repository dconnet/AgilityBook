<h1>Run Properties</h1>
<p>The Run Properties dialog allows you to enter all the information about a run 
you have done. Each run belongs to the trial in which you created it, so the 
Venue, Club and Location fields are only shown for convenience.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgRuns.gif" width="613" height="403"></p>
<p>When you create a new trial, the date will default to either the current date 
(if there are no other runs in the trial), or the last day that has been entered 
in the trial so far. The <b>Division</b>, <b>Level</b> and <b>Event</b> fields 
are dependent on each other. You will see no data in the lower ones until you 
have selected a value in the upper ones. Only values that are valid (determined 
by the <a href="DialogsConfig.html">configuration</a>) are shown.</p>
<p>Several fields will remember their values each time you create a run: 
Division and Level (if the values are valid for the given venue), Height, Judge 
and Handler.</p>
<p>The <b>Conditions</b> field is where you can enter the surface conditions, 
weather, etc.</p>
<p>The <b>Other Points</b> button allows you to configure points you may have 
earned for this run that are not directly recognized by Agility Record Book. For 
instance, breed points. This will bring up a dialog listing all the Other Points 
you have entered. When you create a new entry or edit an existing one, you will 
be taken to the <a href="DlgOtherPoints.html">Other Points dialog</a>.</p>
<p>The <b>Place</b> field is where you can enter how you did. If you do not know 
how you did (or a placement isn't valid due to elimination, etc) or you do not 
know how many dogs competed, simply leave this value as 0. The program will know 
not to use this data then.</p>
<p>The <b>Dogs Q'd</b> field is where you can record how many dogs qualified. If 
you do not know this value, leave this as -1. Do not leave it as 0 (as with the 
placement fields) as that would infer that no dogs qualified.</p>
<p>The <b>Q?</b> field is where you record the qualifying status. Available 
values are: <b>NA</b> (Not applicable), <b>Q</b> (Qualified), <b>NQ</b> (Not 
Qualified), <b>E</b> (Eliminated) or <b>SQ</b> (Super Qualifier, only shown in 
applicable events).</p>
<p>The <b>Score</b> field will show the score for this run. The meaning of this 
value is totally dependent on what the event is.</p>
<p>The <b>Title Points</b> will display how many points you have earned towards 
a title.</p>
<p>The remaining fields all apply to the particular event. Relevant fields will 
be enabled, others will be disabled (grayed out). When you enter an event that 
is based on time-plus-faults, time faults will not be computed. If you enter
0 for a run that is faults-then-time, time faults will also not be computed.
The YPS (yards per second) will be computed automatically when how enter
a course time and yardage.
If the yardage is not known or not applicable, leave this value as 0.</p>

<p>The Comments/Faults page allows you to enter any comments you wish to make. 
The <b>Faults</b> button will bring up a dialog listing all the faults (these 
are also shown in the right side above). From that dialog, you can create a new 
entry or edit an existing one in the <a href="DlgFault.html">Fault dialog</a>.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgRunsReference.gif" width="613" height="403"></p>
<p>The Reference Runs pane allows you to record information about other dogs who 
did this event. This allows you to see how you are doing compared to others.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgRunsCRCD.gif" width="613" height="403"></p>
<p>The CRCD (Clean Run Course Designer) page allows you to copy a course from 
CRCD into Agility Record Book. When the <b>Insert Course</b> button is active, 
it will copy any text that is in the clipboard into this window. It may not be a 
valid CRCD image - Agility Record Book does not know that. It simply acts as a 
storage area for text. If you copy the course while CRCD is running, CRCD will 
also place an image on the clipboard. When you insert the course, Agility Record 
Book will insert both the text and the image. If the image is available, you 
will see it in the above window and the <b>Course Viewer</b> button will be 
active. That button will bring up a <a href="DlgCRCDViewer.html">window</a> that 
will allow you to resize the image.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgRunsLinks.gif" width="613" height="403"></p>
<p>The Links pane allows you to create links to external files. This can be 
convenient if you have used a scanner to create an image of a course. If you 
move (via the file system) any link or wish to copy this file to another 
machine, use the <a href="DlgFindLinks.html">Find Links</a> dialog to find any 
links that may need either fixing or copying. The <b>New</b> and <b>Edit</b> 
buttons will take you to the <a href="DlgSelectUrl.html">Select URL dialog</a>.</p>
