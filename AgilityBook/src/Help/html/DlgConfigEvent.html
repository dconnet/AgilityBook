<h1>Event Configuration Dialog</h1>
<p>The Event Configuration dialog is probably the most complicated of the
configuration dialogs. This is used to define various combinations of divisions
and levels for which this event is valid. Sometimes only one method is required,
though often scoring is done differently at the different levels.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgConfigEvent.gif"></p>
<p>The <b>Name</b> is a unique name identifying this event. The <b>Event Note</b>
is a description that applies to the event as a whole.</p>
<p>The two checkboxes, <b>Has Table?</b> and <b>Has Partners?</b> describe
certain aspects of this event. Enabling the table option will allow this run
adjust the Yards Per Second in the <a href="PropRun.html">Run Properties</a>.</p>
<p>The <b>Has Sub-Names?</b> checkbox is used when a particular event may
actually be composed of several variations. See below for more details.</p>
<p>The order of scoring methods is very important. When attempting to find a
scoring method for a division/level, the first item that is matched will be
used. So if the &quot;&lt;All&gt; / &lt;All&gt;&quot; method were first, no other method would ever be
used.</p>
<p>When this dialog is brought up for a new event, the first thing you must do
(after setting the above information), is to create a new scoring method with
the <b>New</b> button. This will create a method for all divisions and levels.
If you need to refine that (as with the example above), use the <b>Division</b>
and <b>Level</b> controls to select what this method is for. You can use the <b>
Copy</b> button to copy an existing scoring method - this is convenient when
different method vary only a little.</p>
<p>The <b>Valid From</b> and <b>Valid To</b> fields enable scoring methods to
change. For instance, in 2004 USDAA introduced titling programs for the Novice
and Advanced levels. In the dialog below, you can see how the number of methods
increases! (This is also where the <b>Copy</b> button was very convenient!)</p>
<p>

<p>The <b>Scoring Style</b> affects what other controls will be visible. As you
can see, this dialog differs slightly from the first example. The available
scoring styles are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Faults Then Time</b> - Lowest number of faults wins, ties are broken
  by time.</li>
  <li><b>100 Minus Faults Then Time</b> - Score closest to 100 wins, ties are
  broken by time.</li>
  <li><b>200 Minus Faults Then Time</b> - Score closest to 200 wins, ties are
  broken by time.</li>
  <li><b>Opening/Closing Points Then Time</b> - The sum of points earned during
  the opening and closing periods wins, ties are broken by time.</li>
  <li><b>Points Then Time</b> - Greatest number of points wins, ties are broken
  by time. This differs from the above in that it doesn't matter if the points
  were earned during an opening or closing period.</li>
  <li><b>Time Plus Faults</b> - The lowest score when time and faults are
  combined, wins. Note, this style does not compute time faults, unless
  specifically enabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>In some venues, fractional seconds are rounded off when computing faults. The
<b>Drop time fractions for faults</b> option enables this.
Also, the <b>Time Fault Multiplier</b> enables time faults to generate
additional faults, for instance in AKC.</p>
<p>For the &quot;Opening/Closing Points Then Time&quot; style, there will be two fields
visible. These are for designating the number of points that must be earned
during the open and closing periods in order to qualify. When you create a run,
you must have at least that number of points in order to earn title points. As
you can see above, there is only one field for the &quot;Points Then Time&quot; option.
All other options hide these fields.</p>
<p>The <b>Super Q?</b> option is for USDAA Snooker. It means you qualified in
the top 15% of the class. Agility Record Book will not compute this for you.
This is so this option could be used in other venues for similar purposes, even
though the percentage may be different.</p>
<p>The <b>Speed Points?</b> option applies only to AKC runs (at the present).
Speed Points (in AKC, they are known as Mach Points) are computed as the
number of whole seconds below Standard Course Time.</p>
<p>The <b>Bonus Points?</b> option applies only to NADAC runs (at the present).
This is used to identify runs where a Bonus Box may be available allowing
the dog to earn 15 title points if done successfully.
<p>The <b>Title Points</b> section shows how many title points you can earn,
based on the number of faults incurred. In both examples above, you must run
clean. In NADAC (and others), you can still qualify if you, for instance, drop a
bar, but the number of titling points you earn is less. In that case, you would
have multiple entries in this section. The &quot;<b>#</b>&quot; that you see in the
example above means that these titling points also are accumulated in a lifetime
total. In this section, the order of entries is determined by the number of
faults. You cannot create two entries that have the same number of faults.</p>
<p>When you create or edit a Title Points entry, the following dialog will be
displayed:</p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="images/DlgConfigTitlePoints.gif"></p>
<p>The <b>Faults Allowed</b> field allows you to specify what the maximum number
of faults you can incur and still qualify is. The <b>Points</b> is the number of
points you will earn. <b>Lifetime Points?</b> specifies that this
event will accumulate lifetime points. Lifetime points are accumulated across
all divisions, levels and events and displayed in the main
<a href="TabPoints.html">Points View</a>.</p>
<p>Note: If you can qualify in an event and that event has lifetime points, you
must create two entries in the <b>Title Points</b> section (as the dialog above
shows for USDAA Masters Snooker).
The existence of a Lifetime point entry does <i>not</i> imply titling points.
If you do not have a titling point entry, the <b>Q?</b> control in dialog
to create a run will be disabled since the assumption is made that if there
are no titling points available, then you cannot Qualify in that event.
This is useful when you want to create an event for tracking fun-runs.</p>
<h1>Sub Names</h1>
<p>An event is configured for sub-names when multiple variations of the event
exist. An example of these are NADAC's Gamblers class and the game classes in
TDAA. In the NADAC example, we know all the sub-names to start with, so we can
pre-configure the program with them. In TDAA, games are not pre-defined. So,
we can list some initial ones, however the user must be able to enter names
of new events without the need to modify this configuration. In TDAA, we will
create a generic events that the user can add to.</p>
