<h1>Event Configuration Dialog</h1>
<p>The Event Configuration dialog is probably the most complicated of the 
configuration dialogs. This is used to define various combinations of divisions 
and levels for which this event is valid. Sometimes only one method is required, 
often scoring is done differently at the different levels.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgConfigEvent.gif"></p>
<p>The <b>Name</b> is a unique name identifying this event. The <b>Event Note</b> 
is a description that applies to the event as a whole.</p>
<p>The two checkboxes, <b>Has Table?</b> and <b>Has Partners?</b> describe 
certain aspects of this event. Enabling the table option will allow this run 
adjust the Yards Per Second in the <a href="PropRun.html">Run Properties</a>.</p>
<p>The order of scoring methods is very important. When attempting to find a 
scoring method for a division/level, the first item that is matched will be 
used. So if the &quot;&lt;All&gt; / &lt;All&gt;&quot; method were first, no other method would ever be 
used.</p>
<p>When this dialog is brought up for a new event, the first thing you must do 
(after setting the above information), is to create a new scoring method with 
the <b>New</b> button. This will create a method for all divisions and levels. 
If you need to refine that (as with the example above), use the <b>Division</b> 
and <b>Level</b> controls to select what this method is for. You can use the <b>
Copy</b> button to copy an existing scoring method - this is convenient when 
different method vary only a little.</p>
<p>The <b>Valid From</b> and <b>Valid To</b> fields enable scoring methods to 
change. For instance, in 2004 USDAA introduced titling programs for the Novice 
and Advanced levels. In the dialog below, you can see how the number of methods 
increases! (This is also where the <b>Copy</b> button was very convenient!)</p>
<p>

<p>The <b>Scoring Style</b> affects what other controls will be visible. As you 
can see, this dialog differs slightly from the first example. The available 
scoring styles are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Faults Then Time</b> - Lowest number of faults wins, ties are broken
  by time.</li>
  <li><b>100 Minus Faults Then Time</b> - Score closest to 100 wins, ties are 
  broken by time.</li>
  <li><b>200 Minus Faults Then Time</b> - Score closest to 200 wins, ties are 
  broken by time.</li>
  <li><b>Opening/Closing Points Then Time</b> - The sum of points earned during 
  the opening and closing periods wins, ties are broken by time.</li>
  <li><b>Points Then Time</b> - Greatest number of points wins, ties are broken 
  by time. This differs from the above in that it doesn't matter if the points 
  were earned during an opening or closing period.</li>
  <li><b>Time Plus Faults</b> - The lowest score when time and faults are 
  combined, wins. Note, this style does not compute time faults, unless
  specifically enabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>In some venues, fractional seconds are rounded off when computing faults. The
<b>Drop time fractions for faults</b> option enables this.
Also, the <b>Time Fault Multiplier</b> enables time faults to generate
additional faults, for instance in AKC.</p>
<p>For the &quot;Opening/Closing Points Then Time&quot; style, there will be two fields 
visible. These are for designating the number of points that must be earned 
during the open and closing periods in order to qualify. When you create a run, 
you must have at least that number of points in order to earn title points. As 
you can see above, there is only one field for the &quot;Points Then Time&quot; option. 
All other options hide these fields.</p>
<p>The <b>Super Q?</b> option is for USDAA Snooker. It means you qualified in 
the top 15% of the class. Agility Record Book will not compute this for you. 
This is so this option could be used in other venues for similar purposes, even 
though the percentage may be different.</p>
<p>The <b>Speed Points?</b> and <b>Double Q?</b> options apply to AKC runs.
Speed Points (in AKC, they are known as Mach Points) are computed as the
number of whole seconds below Standard Course Time. 
Double Q means that you qualified in two runs that have Double Q ability on the 
same day. That last point is important - for instance, at AKC Nationals, you run
in three rounds in one day, but the Double Q can only be earned if you qualify 
in Standard and JWW, not Hybrid. These options could be used in other venues, 
though no other venue (that I know of) does at this time.</p>
<p>The <b>Title Points</b> section shows how many title points you can earn, 
based on the number of faults incurred. In both examples above, you must run 
clean. In NADAC (and others), you can still qualify if you, for instance, drop a 
bar, but the number of titling points you earn is less. In that case, you would 
have multiple entries in this section. The &quot;<b>#</b>&quot; that you see in the 
example above means that these titling points also are accumulated in a lifetime 
total. In this section, the order of entries is determined by the number of 
faults. You cannot create two entries that have the same number of faults.</p>
<p>When you create or edit a Title Points entry, the following dialog will be 
displayed:</p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="images/DlgConfigTitlePoints.gif"></p>
<p>The <b>Faults Allowed</b> field allows you to specify what the maximum number 
of faults you can incur and still qualify is. The <b>Points</b> is the number of 
points you will earn. <b>Accumulate Lifetime Points?</b> specifies that this 
event will accumulate lifetime points. Lifetime points are accumulated across 
all divisions, levels and events and displayed in the main
<a href="TabPoints.html">Points View</a>.</p>
