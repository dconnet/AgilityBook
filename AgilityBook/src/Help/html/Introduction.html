<p>Agility Record Book is a handy program for tracking all your agility records. 
And it's <i>free</i>! (Ok, we do ask that you make a contribution to your local 
animal shelter or rescue group.) It started life as a humble Excel spreadsheet 
but quickly grew too complicated with all the differences between the various 
venues. On December 28, 2002, Agility Record Book was born!</p>
<p>Agility Record Book is designed to be highly configurable. If a venue changes 
rules or a new venue comes along, there is no need to release a new version of 
the program! All we need to do is update the <a href="DialogsConfig.html">
configuration</a> which lives in your data file.</p>
<p>Agility Record Book has been developed with the input of many people. And 
continues to be! Please <a href="Contact.html">contact</a> us with any comments 
you'd care to share.</p>
