<h1>Configuration Dialog</h1>
<p>The main Configuration dialog present four main areas to work with:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#Venues">Venues</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Faults">Faults</a></li>
  <li><a href="#OtherPoints">Other Points</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Updating">Updating</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The four buttons, <b>New</b>, <b>Edit</b>, <b>Delete</b> and <b>Copy</b>, are 
enabled based on which of the three lists have focus. An easy way to tell which 
action the buttons will perform is to look at the text immediately under the 
buttons. In the example below, the buttons will act on the Venues.</p>
<p>The important thing to understand about the configuration is that it is part 
of your data file. If you have two different files (for instance, you have two 
dogs and decided to keep their information in separate files), then the 
configuration for each dog is in that particular file. This means if you have 
updated one of the configurations, that update has no effect on the other. (This 
is convenient since if you just wanted to tinker the creating/modifying a venue, 
it would have no impact on your real data - assuming you work in a separate 
file!)</p>

<h2>
<a name="Venues">Venues</a></h2>
<p align="left">
When you create a new venue or edit an existing one, the
<a href="DlgConfigVenue.html">Venue Configuration dialog</a> will appear. This 
is an area that you will probably not need to modify unless you are creating a 
new venue. (If you create a new venue, I would really appreciate it if you would
<a href="Contact.html">send me</a> a copy. I can then include it in the default 
configuration of the program. You can do this by running the Import Export 
Wizard and selecting the &quot;Agility Record Book&quot; format and then Export 
Configuration. The resulting file is what I'm interested in.)</p>
<h2>
<a name="Faults">Faults</a></h2>
<p>
When you create a new fault or edit an exiting one, the <a href="DlgFault.html">
Fault dialog</a> will appear. There is usually no need to create any additional 
fault types here. Any that you create in any runs will appear automatically in 
future dialogs. (If you feel there are faults that should be included here, 
please let <a href="Contact.html">me know</a>.)</p>
<h2>
<a name="OtherPoints">Other Points</a></h2>
<p>
The Other Point configuration is probably the area a user is most likely to use. 
Other Points may include things like Breed Points. From discussions with people, 
these are computed differently in almost every breed. So rather than try and 
handle that, I left it to you!</p>
<p>
The trick is to first configure the way points are done here. You can then enter 
any points you earn in each <a href="PropRun.html">run</a> using the &quot;Other 
Points&quot; button.</p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="images/DlgConfigOtherPoints.gif" width="323" height="231"></p>
<p>
<b>Name</b> is what you would like to call this Other Points item.</p>
<p>
<b>Tally Points</b> lists several ways that these points will be accumulated on 
the <a href="TabPoints.html">Points View</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>All Events</b> - This will accumulate all the Other Points found into a 
  single entry. Older versions of the program used to do that to accumulate 
  lifetime points.</li>
  <li><b>Tally by Event</b> - This accumulates all points earned in a specific 
  event, regardless of division or level.</li>
  <li><b>Tally by Level</b> - This accumulates all points earned in a specific 
  division and level, regardless of event.</li>
  <li><b>Tally by Level and Event</b> - This accumulates points based the the 
  division and level, and event.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Description</b> is a good place to put an explanation of how the points are 
computed. When you create a entry on a run, all you enter is the number of 
points earned, so having the computation in front of you when you enter those 
points is very handy.</p>
<h2><a name="Updating">Updating</a></h2>
<p>The <b>Update Configuration</b> button will bring up the following dialog:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgConfigUpdate.gif" width="366" height="126"></p>
<p>This dialog allows you to merge in the default configuration (the one built 
into the program), or to select a specific file to merge. When a new version of 
the program is released and the configuration has changed, the program will 
prompt you at that point if you would like to update your configuration. At that 
point, it has automatically selected the <b>Use Default Configuration</b> option 
for you and by-passed the above dialog. However, if you opted not to update at 
that point, you can do so again at any time by using this dialog. (Updating the 
configuration is also available in the Import Export Wizard.)</p>
<p>If you select the <b>Use Existing Configuration</b> option, you must select 
the name of a file containing the information you wish to merge. This may happen 
if the configuration requires updating, but the program does not. It may also 
happen if a friend of yours creates a new venue and gives you the file so you 
can also use that venue.</p>
<p>Once you press <b>OK</b>, the update will proceed and you will then be 
presented with the results of that merge. Note, the merge process will <i>not</i> 
remove any data. Updating is usually a non-destructive process. (The only time 
it may be destructive is if a venue has changed significantly and revoked an 
existing title. So far, this has never happened. Names have changed, but that is 
different.) If you have removed venues from your configuration, the update 
process will restore them if they exist in the configuration being merged.</p>
