<h1>Export Wizard</h1>
<p>When exporting data, there are a number of items that must be configured.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgExportRuns.gif"></p>
<p>The format of the date must be specified.
This makes sure the date is in a format that can be accepted by whatever
program will be using this data.</p>
<p>The delimiters section allows you to designate the character that separates 
the various fields in the output.
Note, this section will be hidden when exporting to Microsoft Excel
or OpenOffice Calc.</p>
<p>The <a href="DlgAssignCol.html">Assign Columns</a> button allows you to 
specify the actual order of the fields in the data.</p>
<p>When exporting data, any fields that consist of multiple lines will be 
flattened.
This is done specifically because Microsoft Excel and OpenOffice Calc
cannot properly import the data otherwise.
In addition, quotes will be added as necessary to make sure the 
data is exported properly.</p>
