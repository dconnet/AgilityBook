		</ul>

		<li>New features / Enhancements:

			<li>Check for configuration updates when the user requests
			an update check. These are auto-downloaded from the web.
			Configuration checks are also done when a document is opened
			(but only if a previous check loaded the web information
			- opening a document will not access the web).</li>
			<li>Added 'verified' option to trials in the tree (via
			column customization)</li>
			<li>Added dbl-click support in the Points view to see the
			runs behind the data.</li>
			<li>Enable the 'new title' toolbar button in the Points view.</li>
			<li>Enable the merging (via Import) of Dogs, Trials, Runs,
			Judges.</li>
			</li>
			<li>Added an option to disable the splash screen.</li>
			<li>Added tooltips in lists when columns are too small.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Bug Fixes:
		<ul type="disc">
			<li>When updating the configuration, if they are the same
			but the version numbers are different, go ahead and update
			the version number.</li>
			<li>If you dbl-clicked in some of the configuration
			dialogs when nothing was selected, the program faulted.</li>
			<li>Existing other points were tallied in all existing
			other points entries. This resulted in too many points on
			the Points tab.</li>
			<li>Up/Down sort icons on lists were backwards.</li>
			<li type="circle">Changing the scoring type of an existing event
			did not ripple out to existing runs. This could cause a run to be
			stored with the wrong type so when it is read back in, the
			scoring type never got set - which then prevents the file
			from being saved again.
			<ul type="disc">
				<li>In 1.2.1.8, to recreate:</li>
				<li>Create a new file, create a dog, create a trial.</li>
				<li>Edit the configuration to change gamblers to
				faults/time.</li>
				<li>Create a gamblers run.</li>
				<li>Edit the configuration and change gamblers to
				open/close pts.</li>
				<li>Save the file. Close it. Reopen it. This file
				can no longer be saved.</li>
			</ul>
			Fix: When the scoring type of an event is changed, the
			program verifies that no runs are currently using that
			scoring type. If it finds runs are are using it, it will
			warn you that the runs will either be deleted or
			modified. Since the scoring method is being changed or
			deleted, there is no other option. As a user, you can
			choose not to merge the configuration.</li>
			<li>Time+Faults scoring should not also compute time
			faults. You end up double-dinged when they are.</li>
			<li>'Reorder' menu item in the Runs view did nothing,
			disable it.</li>

			<li>Have the calendar start with the current day as the

			<li>When errors are found when loading the data, the

			<li>Allow runs (in tree) and faults (in run) to be
			reordered. Note, sometimes it will appear reordering fails.
			This will be due to sorting. For instance, runs and

			<li>In points view, show the number of partners for Qs,
			not just total number of partners. When tallying the
			number of pairs partners, only 2-dog relays are tallied.
			This prevents some odd things when counting USDAA DAM
			tournament relays.</li>
			<li>After creating a new dog/trial/run (via rclick menu),

			<li>After inserting a trial/run in the tree, it was not
