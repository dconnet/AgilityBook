<h1>Calendar Plugins Dialog</h1>
<p>The Calendar Plugins dialog allows you to read calendar entries from
different locations on the Internet.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgCalendarPlugins.gif"></p>
<p>When this dialog starts, it searches for any plugin DLLs in the executable's
directory. These are displayed with a check mark. This mark indicates to the
<b>Read Entries</b> button which items will have their calendar data loaded.
Depending on the site, this action may take several minutes.</p>
<p>Once the calendar entries are pulled over, the entries are displayed under
their plugin. Checking the calendar entries you want to import will allow
the <b>Add Entries</b> button to add and/or update existing entries.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a plugin will become disabled. This is normally because the
website where we read the data from has changed format. Until a new release
of the plugin is made available, or the website format changes back, there
is nothing that can be done. However, if the plugin became disabled because
the website was temporarily down, it can be re-enabled with the <b>Enable</b>
button.</p>
