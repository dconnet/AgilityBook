<h1>Calendar Plugins Dialog</h1>
<p>The Calendar Plugins dialog allows you to read calendar entries from
different locations on the Internet.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgCalendarPlugins.gif"></p>
<p>When this dialog starts, it searches for any plugin DLLs in the executable's
directory and configuration file.
These are displayed with a check mark.
This mark indicates to the <b>Read Entries</b> button which items will have
their calendar data loaded.
Depending on the site, this action may take several minutes.</p>
<p>Once the calendar entries are pulled over, the entries are displayed under
their plugin.
Checking the calendar entries you want to import will allow the
<b>Add Entries</b> button to add and/or update existing entries.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a plugin will become disabled.
This is normally because the website where we read the data from has changed
format.
Until a new release of the plugin is made available,
or the website format changes back, there is nothing that can be done.
However, if the plugin became disabled because the website was temporarily
down, it can be re-enabled with the <b>Enable</b> button.</p>
<p>Some plugins have additional data that can be configured for the initial
query (the <b>Read Entries</b> button).
This data can limit the locations and venues that are returned.
Click the <b>Details...</b> button to display the following dialog:</p>
