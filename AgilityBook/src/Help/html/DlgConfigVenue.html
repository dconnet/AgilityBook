<h1>Venue Configuration Dialog</h1>
<p>The Venue Configuration dialog allows you to edit various aspects about a 
specific venue.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgConfigVenue.gif"></p>
<p>The venue <b>Name</b> must be unique. There cannot be two venues with the 
same name. The <b>Description</b> field is typically used to enter the web URL, 
though you can insert any comments you wish.</p>
<p>The six buttons located in the center of the dialog are sensitive to which 
control last has focus. The text just below those buttons tell you what item 
they will act on.</p>
<p>When you first open this dialog for an existing venue, the <b>Titles</b> 
section will appear blank. This is because titles are assigned to a specific 
division. You must select a division before anything will appear. In the above 
dialog, the &quot;Standard&quot; division has been selected. All titles available in the 
Standard division are then visible in the Titles section. The <b>Levels</b> 
section is also sensitive to the selected division.</p>
<p>Only the <b>Levels</b> section can have sub-items. Sub-items are items that 
are located under another. For instance, &quot;Novice A&quot; is a sub-item of &quot;Novice&quot;.</p>
<p>When you create or edit the name of a division or level, a simple dialog 
asking for the name will open.</p>
<p>When you create or edit an event, the <a href="DlgConfigEvent.html">Event 
Configuration dialog</a> will open.</p>
<p>When you create or edit a title, the following dialog will open:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgConfigTitle.gif"></p>
<p>The <b>Name</b> of the title is the abbreviation, for instance &quot;NA&quot;. The <b>
Long Name</b> is a more descriptive name, for instance &quot;Novice Agility&quot;. The <b>
Description</b> section is for any notes you would like to make, typically what 
it takes to earn this title.</p>
