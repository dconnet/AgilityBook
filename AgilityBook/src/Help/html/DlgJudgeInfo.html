<h1>Information Dialog</h1>
<p>The Information dialog allows you to record information about any 
club, judge or location.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DlgJudgeInfo.gif"></p>
<p>All clubs, judges or locations that you have currently entered in trials
or runs will be listed.
In addition, you can create an entry, using the <b>New</b> button,
for any club, judge or location that you have not yet used.
You can only delete entries that are not currently in use.</p>
<p>The <b>Visible in lists</b> option allows you to hide an item from being
shown in a selection list. This is useful if you have existing data, but no
longer wish to see that item. For instance, a trial location will never be
used again because it was sold.</p>
