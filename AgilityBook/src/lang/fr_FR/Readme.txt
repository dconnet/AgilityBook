wxWidgets-2.8.12\fr.po file originated in <wx>/locale/fr.po, copied here, edited
in poedit to change charset to utf8 and set the catalog language properly.
Also changed 'plural-forms' to 'Plural-Forms' to make poedit happy.

wxWidgets-3.0.2\fr.po is from <wx>/locale/fr.po (official 3.0 release),
copied here and converted to unix-eol.

trunk\fr.po is from <wx>/locale/fr.po (active trunk), copied here
and converted to unix-eol.

Note: Any future versions of wx:
The directory name here should be the same as the basename of WXWIN.
And set svn:eol-style to LF
