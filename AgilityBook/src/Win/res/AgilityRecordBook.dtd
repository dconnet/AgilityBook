An AgilityRecordBook file is made up of several main sections, see
below for more details.  Multiple dogs may be contained within a file.

In general, all fields are free form. Exceptions will be noted.
 All date attributes are in the form "YYYY-MM-DD".

See comments in DefaultConfig.xml for configuration changes.

Note: When updating the file version number,
see notes in src/ARB/ARBAgilityRecordBook.cpp.

 'version' is used to auto-update a data file. The program will only prompt

The biggest difference in events is in how they are scored. These
are the types of scoring recognized:
 FaultsThenTime    Accumulate faults.
 Faults100ThenTime Subtract faults from 100 and round time faults.
 Faults200ThenTime Subtract faults from 200 and round time faults.
 OCScoreThenTime   Must have a required number of opening and closing pts.
 ScoreThenTime     Must have a required number of pts.
 TimePlusFaults    Score by adding faults and time together.

The 'Division' and 'Level' attributes should enumerate all possible
levels listed in the Division elements (remember a level is 'Level',
not 'SubLevel'). The name may be '*' which will be the default. If not
enumerated, the event will not be offered for that division/level pair.

'dropFractions' means that when computing time faults, fractions are
dropped. (AKC and CPE do this.)

'cleanQ' is used to determine titling points on T+F runs.

'underTF' and 'overTF' are used to cause time faults to be computed on
Time+Faults style events (USDAA Time Gamble). They are also used to specify
faults in ScoreThenTime events (DOCNA Strategic gamble).

'subtractFT' will cause the time faults to be subtracted from the run's score.

The 'superQ', 'speedPts' and 'bonusPts' attributes enable built-in
features for an event. (note: bonusPts are actually bonus titling points)

'obstacles' specified the number of obstacles attempted so an obstacles per
second figure can be computed. On opening/closing time runs (gambles), only
the opening time is used. Other runs use the dog's time.

'hasTable' specifies that this run might have a table. This is used as the
default when creating a run.

'timeFault' is a multiplier when a run has time faults.

If a scoring method has speed points, the PlaceInfo entries define the
multipliers for placements. If SpeedPts='n', PlaceInfo entries are ignored.

Entries in 'TitlePoints' determines if a Q should/not be awarded. When
data is entered in the program, the program will perform certain tests.
If it thinks you should/not Q and you enter data differently,
it will ask if you really mean that.
Type: Norm, T2B, UKI

If there are no 'TitlePoints', then the class is non-titling.

Placements is used to count the number of places earned (used in FCI, SCC)
