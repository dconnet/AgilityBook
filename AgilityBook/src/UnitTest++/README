These files are all the original UnitTest 1.5.1 files, except Makefile.in.
Note: docs/UnitTest++.html is from v1.4.
Note: src/* is UnitTest++/* from 1.5.1

1.5 switched to using CMake. I don't. Makefile.in is ARB's makefile.

The files in src/Posix have been copied into src with the prefix 'posix_'
to avoid some makefile issues.
