Notes for releasing a new version.

Files to change before marking files for release:
- If file version has changed:
  - If major version has changed, make sure last part of pgm version agrees.
  - Update comments in src/Win/res/AgilityRecordBook.dtd (update website too)
  - Update the version in DefaultConfig.xml
  - Plus: Make sure that the Update() methods have been updated!
    If this is missed, the new data will not be merged.
- If configuration has changed:
  - Same as file version changing above
- Update CD Label (SureThing CD Labeler Deluxe v3.12)
- Update help\html\images\DlgAbout.gif
- History.txt
  Update program version and date, along with any comments.
  - Reflect these changes into help/html/HistoryData.html
  - Run "src\UpdateHistory.py -h"
- Todo.txt
  Any necessary changes...

Run Doxygen and fix any warnings/errors it reports.
  - cd ...\AgilityBook
  - doxygen AgilityBook.dox

Do a full rebuild and verify it.
- cd src\Projects\VC8
- BuildAll.bat
  - Note: Ignore errors from ParseResourceHeader during x64 build. It
    obviously won't run on a 32bit system.
  - Create AgilityBook_n_n_n_n-win.zip from msi in bin\VC8\Unicode Release
  - Create AgilityBook_n_n_n_n-win98.zip from msi in bin\VC8\Release
  - Create AgilityBook_n_n_n_n-x64.zip from msi in bin\VC8x64\Unicode Release
  - Check Misc\Installations\InstallGUIDs.csv (updated from BuildAll/GenMSI.py
- The VC6 and VC7 versions should also be built just to make sure they work.

Tag SubVersion repository

Create the files to be distributed (make sure you archive them too)

- Create AgilityBook_n_n_n_n-ALT.zip (VC8 AgilityBook.exe/.chm/arbzlib.dll)
  Copy this to distrib\vN.N.N.N\
- Clean out all build artifacts.
- AgilityBook_n_n_n_n-src.zip
  - Remove all source control files from zip (just being clean)
  - Copy this to distrib\vN.N.N.N\
- Readme1st.vn.n.n.n.txt
  - Copy Misc/Instructions.txt to Readme1st.vn.n.n.n.txt and modify [if needed]

In Yahoo
- Note: Files are no longer released on Yahoo (as of v1.8)
- Send an email announcing new release - send as a 'Special Notice' from Yahoo.

Backup:
- Backup development directory onto CD.
  - Remove unnecessary files (build relics, svn)

Prepare for next release:
- Update src/Win/AgilityBook.rc: VERSIONINFO
- Update History.txt
- Update src/Projects/Win32/VC8/AgilityBookSetup.vdproj
  - Open in VS8, select the setup project on the solutions tab, switch
    to the properties tab and update 'Version'. Say Yes to changing the
    ProductCode/etc GUIDs. (Note, if you decide to change the version
    number later, do not change the ProductCode again)
  - Update src/Projects/Win32/VC8/AgilityBookSetup98/64.vdproj
    - Manually copy the GUIDs from AgilityBookSetup.vdproj
  - Note: Often VERSION.DLL gets unmarked for exclusion - to prevent, do the
    following after changing the version:
    - Rebuild everything (will show version.dll as excluded).
    - Save all changes and exit the program.
    - Start program again and open project (now shown as included).
    - Mark as excluded.
    Things should remain okay now.
