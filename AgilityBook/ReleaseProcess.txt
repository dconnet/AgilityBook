Notes for releasing a new version.

[On new year, update License.txt and src/Include/VersionNumber.h.]

Files to change before marking files for release:
- If file version has changed (arb version, not build number):
  - Update comments in src/Win/res/AgilityRecordBook.dtd (update website too)
  - Update the version in DefaultConfig.xml
  - Plus: Make sure that the Update() methods have been updated!
    If this is missed, the new data will not be merged.
- If configuration has changed:
  - Same as file version changing above
  - Make sure it is added to TestARB (TestConfig.cpp)
- Update CD Labels
  - lsl: LightScribe Template Labeler
- History.txt
  Update program version and date, along with any comments.
  - Reflect these changes into help/html/HistoryData.html
  - Run "src\UpdateHistory.py -h -w"
    (note: while a help file is no longer actually generated, continue doing
    this as the website pulls it's data from this too. And at some point, I
    may reinstate the help file [-h: arbhelp, -w: website])
- Todo.txt
  Any necessary changes...

Run Doxygen and fix any warnings/errors it reports.
- cd ...\AgilityBook
- doxygen AgilityBook.dox

Do a full rebuild and verify it.
- cd src\Projects\Installer
- 'BuildAll.py -w %WXBASE%\wxWidgets-3.0.0 -b fullupdate' [runs VC10 compile]
  - BuildAll options: -w wxwin [-b fullupdate | clean] compiler*
      -w wxwin: Root of wx tree, normally %WXBASE%\wxWidgets-3.0.0'
	            Default is %WXWIN%
      -b type:  type is 'fullupdate', 'clean', or 'dirty' (default, dirty)
      -t:       Testing, just print commands to run
      compiler: vc10, vc11 (default: vc10)
- Run 'GenMSI.py /all' to create w32/x64 installers and auto-update
  Misc\Installations\InstallGUIDs.csv
  - Copy .msi files to \AgilityBook\distrib\vN.N.N.N, zip them.

Commit all changes to SVN.

Pull files onto Mac and build there (see MAC_BUILD.txt)
- Update Project Version in xcode target properties (x.y.z)
  (unless this was done as prep for a new release below)
On Mac10.5:
- export PATH=$WXWIN/build-carbon:$PATH
- cd .../AgilityBook
- autoconf
- rm -rf build-carbon
- mkdir build-carbon
- cd build-carbon
- ../configure
On Mac10.9:
- export PATH=$WXWIN/build-cocoa:$PATH
- cd .../AgilityBook
- autoconf
- rm -rf build-cocoa
- mkdir build-cocoa
- cd build-cocoa
- ../configure
Both:
- make dist
- Use the '/Application/Utilities/Disk Utility' to create a dmg file
  - Name it AgilityBook-n_n_n_n-mac.dmg
  - After dragging in image, rename the mount point. (AgilityBook x.y.z)
  - Unmount and 'Convert' in DU (save as same name) to compress.

Commit all changes to SVN (should just be the xcode project).

Tag SubVersion repository
 - /tags/vn.n.n.n

Create the files to be distributed (make sure you archive them too)
- Any extra readme files required
- Copy a backup of released files to \AgilityBook\test\[vc10/vc10x64]
  Currently, I only archive vc10/x64 - the exe's that are released to the wild.
  [exe,dll,dat,lang/...]
- Use SVN to export AgilityBook\ to distrib\AgilityBook\ directory
  - Zip AgilityBook to AgilityBook-n_n_n_n-src.zip
  - Delete AgilityBook directory
- Readme1st.vn.n.n.n.txt
  - Copy Misc/Instructions.txt to Readme1st.vn.n.n.n.txt and modify [if needed]

SourceForge:
- Upload all files (https://sourceforge.net/projects/agilitybook/files/)
  - Readme1st.vn.n.n.n.txt
  - AgilityBook-n_n_n_n-src.zip
  - AgilityBook-n_n_n_n-win.zip
  - AgilityBook-n_n_n_n-x64.zip
  - AgilityBook-n_n_n_n-mac.dmg
- Set default file information (sets up file to auto-download)
  - Windows: -win
  - Mac: -mac
  - Others: -src

Web Site:
- Upload msi zip files and dmg to files/
- Update "$fileversion" and "$fileVerNo" in func.php
- Update version2.xml and version.txt
  - Run 'ARBUpdater /g' and generate new size and md5/sha1 tags for each file.
  - Update config file (ConfigN.txt) [if necessary]
- Make sure things are current (ongoing task!).
  - Update DTD
  - Update bugs.php, index.php
  - Update news.xml (RSS feed)
- Push all updated files to server.
- Verify downloads are good.
  - Verify auto-update works from program
- Delete old zip files.

In Yahoo
- Note: Files are no longer released on Yahoo (as of v1.8)
- Send an email announcing new release - send as a 'Special Notice' from Yahoo.

Backup:
- Backup development directory onto CD.
  - Remove unnecessary files (build relics, svn)

Prepare for next release:
- Update version number
  - This is done by editing .../include/VersionNumber.h
- Update History.txt
- Update CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION in xcode 
  (so it doesn't have to be done as part of the release process)
