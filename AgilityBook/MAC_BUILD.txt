		   Universal Binary Build on MacOS

0. gettext package (from MacPorts): http://gettext.darwinports.com/
   - Also, it's highly recommended to update svn (sudo port install svn)

1. boost package from MacPorts: sudo port install boost

2. Download and install WxMac (wxWidgets) in a local directory
[see http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Getting_started_on_OS_X]
This seems to be the preferred install method for wxWidgets and allows you to
change settings of the library w/o having to be root and it allows you to have
multiple versions simultaneously with different settings
-- Set WXWIN to point to this directory (makes paths easier to set)

extract the tar to a directory (i.e ~/wx/wxWidgets-n.n.n [$WXWIN])
- Apply all patches noted in Readme.txt
- See build/setupwx and build/setwxpath.
  - setupwx: Makes configuring WX easy.
    [Note: the configure output should show all libraries as either 'builtin' or 'no']
  - setwxpath: Makes configuring build environment easy.
> cd <build directory>
  - Name will always be "build-[ansi|unicode][-debug]"
> make

Now you need to put this version of wx-config on your path so when you make
agilitybook it picks this version of wxMac
> export PATH=$WXWIN/build-unicode:$PATH
(use ". ./setwxpath 2.8 unicode" to do this)

3. Build agilitybook as universal binary for PPC and Intel 32 bit architectures
> cd AgilityBook/
> autoconf
> mkdir build-unicode
> cd build-unicode
> ../configure CC=gcc-4.0 CXX=g++-4.0 LD=g++-4.0
> make dist

4a. To package the distribution bundle [optional] [note, I do not do this]
- open /Developer/Applications/Utilities/PackageMaker
- select the Open menu option and open the Package Maker package build/AgilityRecordBook.pmdoc
- select the Build option and save the package wherever you like.

4b. To create a disk image:
- Open /Applications/Utilities/Disk\ Utility
- Create a new image
- Selecting a 40MB image is good, 10 is too small.
- Once mounted, drag AgilityBook.app in. Change the mounted name.
- Unmount
- Click 'Convert' (in Disk Utility) and compress.
